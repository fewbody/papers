      "summary": "Author(s): M. Sguazzin et al.The probabilities of an excited atomic nucleus to emit particles and γ rays provide important information on the nuclear level density as well as the γ-ray strength function. These statistical quantities are important to model nuclear reactions including the complex nucleosynthesis networks that have formed the elements that exist today. But these emission probabilities are hard to come by in the laboratory. The authors demonstrate how they have achieved this challenging task with a new experimental approach, by exciting the stable, doubly magic nucleus 208Pb in inelastic proton scattering on a hydrogen gas-jet target inside the Experimental Storage Ring (ESR) at the GSI facility, and by detecting the lead (Pb) beamlike ions instead of the emitted γ rays or neutrons. Such measurements in inverse kinematics in a storage ring are free from complications by, e.g., competing reactions or energy loss in a fixed target. Here, the 208Pb beam passes the low-density hydrogen target a million times per second, restoring the luminosity in the regime of the thin target that preserves pristine excitation-energy resolution and particle identification capability, and enables outstanding detection efficiencies. The present results along with improvements under development promise future results for many short-lived nuclei of interest in astrophysics and nuclear science applications.[Phys. Rev.

Whereas most experiments so far have assumed elastic transitions for muon-to-electron conversion, this paper shows how inelastic transitions which leave the nucleus in an excited state would allow for more probes of new physics. Such transitions can modify the near-endpoint spectrum of conversion electrons, to which the underlying flavor-symmetry violating operator is sensitive. The authors find that 27Al, the target of ongoing muon-to-electron conversion experiments, is an excellent isotope choice to observe inelastic transitions.[Phys. Rev.

      "summary": "Starting from the measurements conducted in 2004 with the ADAMO silicon spectrometer, we have performed a 2D fit procedure to diverse combinations of muon flux datasets documented in the literature. The fit employed three different formulas describing the energy and angular distribution of atmospheric muons at the Earth’s surface. The analysis revealed that some measurements showed discrepancies in their compatibility with the expected results or between them with variations greater than a few sigmas. For example, vertical measurements expand over a wide range of flux values even for similar setup experiments. However, we have identified a formula capable of furnishing comprehensive spectrum coverage utilizing a singular set of parameters. Despite inherent limitations, we have achieved a satisfactory agreement with the Guan parameterization. Subsequently, we have integrated this optimized parameterization into the EcoMug library and a Geant4-based muon generator. The model’s predictive capabilities have been validated by comparing it with experimental flux measurements and against other measurements in the literature. Through this process, we have shown and tested the reliability and accuracy of different muon flux modelling, facilitating advancements in domains reliant on the precise characterization of atmospheric muon phenomena."

      "summary": "Transverse momentum correlations were recently measured by the ALICE collaboration at the LHC [Acharya etal (2020 Phys. Lett. B804 135375)]. A long-range structure in terms of relative pseudorapidity of particle pairs is observed. This may imply some signal of the initial state owing to the sheer spread of the correlation. However, the fluctuations inside a thermally equilibrated medium have to be taken into account, serving as motivation for this paper. Using lattice Quantum Chromodynamics constraints, we predicted the development and spread of balancing correlations caused by energy-momentum conservation. At the same time, we propagated the Gaussian-shaped initial correlation using hydrodynamics to estimate its effects. Our findings suggest that the resulting correlation, known as ‘the ridge,’ is sensitive both to flucutations seeded in the pre-equilibrium stage and to those seeded in the equilibrated medium. This can provide important insight into the early stages of the collision."

As a result, trigger strategies play a key role in extracting relevant information from the vast streams of data produced at facilities like the large hadron collider (LHC). As the energy and luminosity of the collisions increase, these strategies must be upgraded and maintained to suit the experimental needs. This whitepaper presents a high-level overview and reviews recent developments of triggering practices employed at the LHC. The general trigger principles applied at modern HEP experiments are highlighted, with specific reference to the current trigger state-of-the-art within the ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb collaborations. Furthermore, a brief synopsis of the new trigger paradigm required by the upcoming high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC is provided. This whitepaper, compiled by Early Stage Researchers of the SMARTHEP network, is not meant to provide an exhaustive review or substitute documentation and papers from the collaborations themselves, but rather offer general considerations and examples from the literature that are relevant to the SMARTHEP network."

The proposed detector design was simulated using the Geant4 framework, featuring segmented modules of plastic scintillators doped with gadolinium to enhance neutron capture efficiency. Inverse beta decay (IBD) events generated by ERNIE and background events produced by cosmic ray simulations were used to train and test an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model for signal-background discrimination. The model demonstrated high discrimination accuracy for prompt IBD events but encountered challenges with delayed neutron background discrimination due to similarities in neutron capture. Performance comparisons with traditional cut-based analyses highlighted the improved accuracy achieved through machine learning, particularly when utilizing additional event features. This work establishes the potential of gadolinium-doped plastic scintillators and machine learning in enhancing neutrino detection and lays the groundwork for future experimental validation and detector optimization."

      "summary": "We consider a general model for a quasi-spherical explosion in which a part of the explosion energy is thermalized, forming an expanding photosphere around a compact object, and the second part of energy is taken by the expanding shell of material which forms a shock wave in the surrounding medium. Different types of particles (electrons, hadrons) can, in principle, be accelerated at the shock. They interact with the thermal radiation from the photosphere and also with the material at the shell. We determine the equilibrium spectra of particles in the shell as a function of time after explosion and calculate the time-dependent γ-ray spectra by taking into account the effects which are due to the anisotropy of the photo-spheric radiation field on the Inverse Compton (IC) process; we also include the absorption of IC γ-rays in the photosphere radiation. We conclude that, in principle, both leptonic and hadronic models can explain the GeV-TeV gamma-ray emission recently detected from the Nova RS Oph. However, the hadronic model, in comparison to the leptonic model, is more energetically demanding and requires much stronger magnetization of the nova shell."

In this study, we consider two gluon operators for which the hybrid-ratio renormalization matching kernels have been recently derived and a third operator that has been used in prior pseudo-PDF studies of the gluon PDFs. We compare the matrix elements for each operator for both the nucleon and pion, at both pion masses, and using two gauge-smearing techniques. Focusing on the more phenomenologically studied nucleon gluon PDF, we compare the ratio and hybrid-ratio renormalized matrix elements at both pion masses and both smearings to those reconstructed from the nucleon gluon PDF from the CT18 global analysis. We identify the best choice of operator to study the gluon PDF and present the first gluon quasi-PDF under some caveats. Additionally, we explore the recent idea of Coulomb gauge fixing to improve signal at large Wilson-line displacement and find it could be a major help in improving the signal in the gluon matrix elements. This work helps identify the best operator for studying the gluon quasi-PDF, shows higher hadron boost momentum is needed to implement hybrid-ratio renormalization reliably, and suggests the need to study more diverse set of operators with their corresponding perturbative calculations for hybrid-ratio renormalization to further gluon quasi-PDF study."

Precisely measuring their results remains a difficult task in experiments, when employing the centrality bin width correction (CBWC) to suppress the initial volume fluctuations. Various techniques within the CBWC formula can lead to notable differences in the results. We will systematically investigate the application of the CBWC method to the measured net-proton C5/C1 and C6/C2 using the UrQMD model and Skellam-based simulations at = 11.5 GeV in Au + Au collisions. A recommended approach is proposed to calculate C5/C1 and C6/C2 in 0%–40% centrality. With statistics comparable to the RHIC beam energy scan phase II (BES-II), our studies provide a baseline for analyzing net-proton C5/C1 and C6/C2 in relativistic heavy-ion collisions."

Important aspects like energy conservation and effects on particle production and flow are discussed. It is shown, that this new implementation reproduces qualitatively and quantitatively available data over a wide range of beam energies and improves the description of observables without exception. In particular the description of hyperon and pion production at SIS18 energies is improved. From a comparison with HADES data one could conclude that the present parametrization of the CMF model leads to a slightly too weak momentum dependence. However, a more firm conclusion will require a systematic comparison with flow and multiplicity data over a range of beam energies and system sizes. Our work serves as an important step towards such future studies where the properties of dense QCD matter, through parameters of the CMF model, can be constraint using a comparison of the UrQMD model with high precision heavy ion data, finally also allowing direct comparisons with neutron star and neutron star merger observables."

The experiment utilized germanium targets with natural isotopic composition. Irradiation of the targets was performed using a proton beam from the AIC-144 accelerator at the Institute of Nuclear Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Krakow. Gamma spectroscopy was conducted with high-purity germanium detectors to measure the gamma-ray emissions from the irradiated targets. This enabled the determination of reaction cross-sections of the produced radionuclides. Additionally, our results were compared with existing literature and TALYS data to validate our findings. Generally, our experimental results align with previous studies, although discrepancies were observed in certain aspects.

These perturbations include oblateness, triaxiality, radiation pressure, and the effects of Coriolis and centrifugal forces. Recent advancements have shifted focus to systems involving more than three bodies, with notable work in the four-body problem. In this study, we extend the analysis to the five-body problem, examining its chaotic behavior and identifying regions of libration points. By varying the masses of the bodies across distinct surface points, we analyze the system’s dynamics, uncovering fractal zones within the problem. Additionally, we perform a stability analysis of the libration points, offering new insights into the behavior and stability of the five-body system. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of multi-body interactions and their implications in both theoretical and applied contexts."

The study focuses on the low-lying excited doublet states 1$$s^{{2}}$$ns, 1$$s^{{2}}n$$p, and 1$$s^{{2}}n$$d, utilizing plasma potentials such as the screened Coulomb (SCP), exponential cosine screened Coulomb (ECSCP), and Hulthén potentials. Energy eigenvalues are determined using appropriate trial wave functions, which account for electron–electron repulsion and spin parts to adhere to the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Moreover, two factors related to the wave function of the compressed system and ECSCP model are considered. The results reveal an intriguing relative ordering for the lithium atom using the three plasma models, with many of the findings being significant contributions yet to be explored."

On the one hand, after determining the potential parameters according to experimental data, EQS and N–U results are compared to the numerical ones to show the effectiveness of our calculations. On the other hand, the effects of the non-linearity introduced via energy-dependent potentials in the Schrödinger equation are shown through a comparison made between energy-dependent and position-only-dependent cases of the Manning-Rosen potential. We considered some diatomic molecules CO$$^{+}$$, BO, and CN with the experimental values of their potential parameters. Our results allowed us to consider, as a particular case, the three-dimensional energy-dependent Hulthén potential.\n"

To classify the singly heavy pentaquark structures, we employ the special unitary representation. By using the SU(3) flavor representation, singly heavy pentaquark states are classified into the allowed flavor multiplets. Also, by using the extension of the Gursey-Radicati mass formula and the effective mass scheme, masses of singly heavy pentaquark states are estimated. Further, magnetic moments of singly heavy pentaquarks have been calculated using the effective mass and the screened charge schemes. A thorough comparison of our results shows reasonable agreement with the available theoretical data and may be helpful for future experimental studies."

A perturbative treatment of contact terms when solving the three-nucleon (3N) continuum Faddeev equation seems to be particularly well suited to dealing with variable strengths of such components in the chiral 3NF. A significant reduction of the computation time achieved in this way makes such an approach a valuable tool for fine-tuning of the 3N Hamiltonian parameters."

The measurements cover a range of 8–16 MeV for the incident proton beam. The angular distributions of the $$\\gamma $$-rays have been measured. A detailed phenomenological analysis within the framework of optical model formalism has been carried out to reproduce the experimental data. The existing global set of elastic, polarization and total reaction data for protons and neutrons have been used to generate the optical model potential. The nuclear structure effects have been included in the calculations by considering the roles of coupling of the low-lying states, the presence of resonances and nuclear deformations. The potentials so generated have been used to calculate the differential and total cross sections for both (p,p$$^\\prime $$) and (p,p$$^\\prime \\gamma $$) reactions. The results of the analysis are in good agreement with the measured data for the observed $$\\gamma $$-rays. However, discrepancies still exist in reproducing the finer details of the cross sections. The existing discrepancies between our phenomenological analysis and the experimental data demonstrate the rather complex roles of channel couplings, resonances in the compound nuclear system and target deformation. The significant contribution of nuclear structure effects in light mass nucleus like $$^{12}$$C and $$^{16}$$O, leads to an apparent loss of predictive power of the theoretical calculation for low-energy region (less than 10 MeV) of the projectile energy."

A model based on the Eckart potential is introduced for an effective description in the universal window. In this model, the short-range interaction is considered as a whole, similar to how the s-wave phase-shift $$\\delta $$ functions in describing low-energy nucleon–nucleon scattering data. Based on our analysis, we confirm that the obtained parameters accurately represent the characteristics of the short-range physics and the influence of the up-down quark mass difference on the charge symmetry breaking is less significant as initially anticipated. Additionally, we suggest evaluating the charge symmetry breaking of the short-range interaction rather than solely focusing on the nuclear interaction."

Indeed, with the notable exception of a few special cases, their associated Schrödinger equation cannot be solved analytically for more than two particles. One has to resort to approximation methods to tackle quantum few-body problems. In particular, variational methods have been proposed to ease numerical calculations and obtain precise solutions. One such method is the Stochastic Variational Method, which employs a stochastic search to determine the number and parameters of correlated Gaussian basis functions used to construct an ansatz of the wave function. Stochastic methods, however, face numerical and optimization challenges as the number of particles increases.We introduce a family of gradient variational methods that replace stochastic search with gradient optimization. We comparatively and empirically evaluate the performance of the baseline Stochastic Variational Method, several instances of the gradient variational method family, and some hybrid methods for selected few-body problems. We show that gradient and hybrid methods can be more efficient and effective than the Stochastic Variational Method. We discuss the role of singularities, oscillations, and gradient optimization strategies in the performance of the respective methods."

Our findings indicate that the photon sphere and BH shadow radii decrease owing to the quantum correction parameter α, which acts as a repulsive gravitational charge. Further, we investigate the gravitational weak lensing by applying the general formalism used to model the deflection angle of the light traveling around the quantum-corrected BH within the plasma medium. We show, in conjunction with the fact that the combined effects of the quantum correction and non-uniform plasma frequency parameter can decrease the deflection angle, that the light traveling through the uniform plasma can be strongly deflected than the non-uniform plasma environment surrounding the quantum-corrected BH.

Different proximity potentials are used to calculate the decay half-lives of nuclei. The fragmentation potential and preformation distribution suggest that SF is the major contributor up to , and HPR starts competing for heavier nuclei. The heavy cluster emission is supported by Pb-magicity, whereas SF is reinforced owing to the deformations of fission fragments. The heavy cluster decay half-lives (log TC) are calculated using the PCM and are compared with the estimates of the analytical super asymmetric fission (ASAF) model. The calculated log TC values agree well with the ASAF measurements when using the Prox-00 and Mod Prox-00 versions of potentials. However, Prox-77, Prox-88, and Prox-BW-91 are not appropriate to address the log TC for nuclei. To resolve this, we include Z-dependence in the radius parameters. Interestingly, the half-lives match the ASAF data after the inclusion of Z-dependence. The branching ratios are also calculated for superheavy nuclei and compared with the estimates of unified description (UD) formula, universal curve (UNIV), universal decay law (UDL), Horoi formula, and ASAF measurements. Furthermore, the SF half-lives ( ) of Cn, Cn, Fl, and Fl superheavy nuclei are estimated through various proximity potentials. Among them, Prox-00 is appropriate for addressing the experimental data. Using this potential, the SF half-lives are estimated through the PCM for isotopes at different neck-length parameters.

Polytropic EOS, Chandrasekar EOS, and Harrison-Wheeler EOS are employed for calculation. Haensel and Potekhin's unified EOS of neutron-star matter based on FPS and SLy EOSs are used for tests. Bremsstrahlung calculations are tested on existing measurements of bremsstrahlung in the scattering of protons off 197Au nuclei at a proton beam energy of MeV.

The effects of shear viscosity and the sub-nucleon structure on anisotropic flow and flow fluctuation are analyzed. Our result shows that shear viscosity tends to suppress both flow coefficients ( , , and ) and flow fluctuation ( ) owing to its smearing effect on local density fluctuation. The flow coefficients appear to be insensitive to the sub-nucleon structure, whereas the flow fluctuation tends to be suppressed by the sub-nucleon structure in central collisions but enhanced in peripheral collisions. After taking into account the sub-nucleon structure effect, our numerical result can qualitatively describe the relative flow fluctuations ( , ) measured by the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC. We further investigate the effects of shear viscosity, sub-nucleon structure, and initial condition model on the flow angle and flow magnitude decorrelations ( , ) using the four-particle correlation method. We find that the flow decorrelation effect is typically stronger in central collisions than in peripheral collisions. The flow angle decorrelation is found to be insensitive to the shear viscosity and sub-nucleon structure, whereas the flow magnitude decorrelation shows quite different behaviors when using the TRENTO and AMPT initial condition models.

The mirror-skin thickness of $ N = 20 $ isotones and $ Z = 20 $ isotopes is studied by using Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) calculations with various Skyrme EDFs and adding CSB and charge independence breaking (CIB) terms. It is shown that the mirror-skin thickness is sensitive only to the CSB EDF, but hardly depends on either the isospin symmetric part of the nuclear EDF or the CIB term. Therefore, this observable can be used to extract the magnitude of the CSB term in the EDF quantitatively, either from experimental data or ab initio calculations. We have studied the accuracy in the mirror-skin thickness that is needed to extract sensible information. Our study may also help to understand the inconsistency between the strength of the phenomenological CSB and that extracted from ab initio calculations [Naito et al. Nuovo. Cim. C 47, 52 (2024)]. Among possible mirror pairs for experimental study, we propose the mirror-skin thickness between $ {}^{42} \\mathrm{Ca} $ and $ {}^{42} \\mathrm{Ti} $, which could be accessed in future experiments in RIBF and/or FRIB."

PHSD is a microscopic, non-equilibrium approach that integrates hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom, providing a comprehensive description of relativistic heavy-ion collisions from initial nucleon-nucleon interactions to quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation, hadronization, and final-state interactions. Key dilepton sources in PHSD include hadronic decays, bremsstrahlung, QGP radiation ($q+\\bar q \\to e^+e^-$, \\ $q+\\bar q \\to g+ e^+e^-$, \\ $q+g \\to q+ e^+e^-$), primary Drell-Yan production, and semileptonic decays of correlated charm and bottom pairs. PHSD well describes dilepton data from HADES, STAR, and ALICE experiments. We examine in-medium effects, such as the vector meson spectral function broadening, and present the excitation function for the dilepton \"excess\" in the invariant mass range $0.4<0.75$ GeV/c$^2$. For the first time we report on the baryon chemical potential $\\mu_B$-dependence of the QGP radiation calculated on a basis of the Dynamical-Quasi-Particle Model (DQPM) in PHSD. The influence of $\\mu_B$ on the QGP yield grows at lower collision energies, where $\\mu_B$ becomes large, however, its impact on the total dilepton spectra is small due to the lowering of the QGP volume with decreasing energy. The excitation function of QGP dileptons, is presented versus correlated charm, confirming that the QGP radiation overshines charm contributions at $\\sqrt{s} \\simeq 25-30$ GeV in central Au+Au collisions, providing access to thermal QGP dileptons at BES RHIC and FAIR."

This leads to a more realistic description of nuclear partition function which poses one of the largest uncertainties in the mass fraction calculations under conditions of NSE.

The excitation energy spectrum above the $t$+$t$ threshold in $^{6}$He is measured via the fragmentation excitation process during the breakup reaction of $^{9}$Li on a $^{208}$Pb target at an incident energy of 32.7 MeV/nucleon. The resonant states are reconstructed from the final state coincident particles $t$+$t$ using the invariant mass method, while the non-resonant background is estimated using the event mixing method.

To better understand these mechanisms, we use multi-particle correlations to reconstruct jet anisotropies. We simulate data using TennGen as a hydro-like background and combine it with PYTHIA-generated jets, clustering them with the anti-$k_{T}$ algorithm.

Several phase transitions must have occurred in neutron stars as well such as transitions from normal to superfluid/superconducting phases and crust formation. In this work, we extend the superfluid band theory, which has been formulated in our previous work [K. Yoshimura and K. Sekizawa, Phys. Rev. C 109, 065804 (2024)] based on the Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) for superfluid systems, into the finite temperature and finite magnetic field systems. As a result of the finite temperature calculations, we find that the superfluidity of neutrons dissapears at around $k_\\text{B}T=0.6$--$0.9\\,$ MeV, and ``melting'' of nuclear slabs, that is, a structural change into the uniform matter, takes place at around $k_\\text{B}T=2.5$--$4.5\\,$ MeV. We also reveal that these transition temperatures exhibit a systematical dependence on the baryon densities. By turning on the magnetic field, we find that protons' spin gets polarized at around $B=10^{16}\\,$G, whereas neutrons' spin is kept unpolarized on average up to around $B=10^{17}\\,$G. Intriguingly, our microscopic calculations reveal that neutrons' spin is actually polarized locally inside and outside of the slab already at $B\\sim10^{16}\\,$G, while keeping the system unpolarized in total. As a conclusion, we have demonstrated validity and usefulness of the fully self-consistent superfluid nuclear band theory for describing neutron star matter under arbitrary temperature and magnetic field. Critical temperatures and magnetic fields have been predicted for 1) superfluid to normal transition, 2) crust formation, and 3) spin polarization, under conditions relevant to realistic neutron star environments."

Together with the total nucleon density profiles of doubly-magic nuclei obtained from the Skyrme Hartree-Fock calculation, we discuss the spatial distribution of quartet correlations in finite nuclei within the local density approximation. Large quartet condensate fractions are found at the surface region of an atomic nucleus due to the strong neutron-proton attractive interactions responsible for the deuteron formation in vacuum. Moreover, we discuss a possible microscopic origin of the Wigner term in the context of nucleon-quartet scattering in dilute symmetric nuclear matter. The nucleon-quartet scattering effect on the Wigner term is numerically estimated as about one order of magnitude of the total empirical strength, indicating the importance of multi-nucleon clusters in the symmetry energy and mass formula in addition to the neutron-proton pairing."

In this paper we study the effect of nuclear deformation on the computed electron capture cross section on selected even even chromium isotopes (464850Cr). The nuclear deformation parameters were computed using two different theoretical models: Interacting Boson Model (IBM 1) and Macroscopic (Yukawa plus exponential) microscopic (Folded Yukawa) model (Mac mic model). A third value of deformation parameter was adopted from experimental data. We chose the pn QRPA model to perform our calculations. The predictive power of the chosen model was first tested by calculating Gamow Teller (GT) strength distributions of selected fp shell nuclei where measured GT data was available. The calculated GT strength distributions were well fragmented over the energy range 0 12 MeV and were noted to be in decent agreement with experimental data. The total GT strength was found to increase (decrease) with decrease (increase) in the value of deformation parameter for the three chromium isotopes. The computed GT strength distributions satisfied the model independent Ikeda sum rule. The ECC were calculated as a function of the deformation parameter at core temperature 1.0 MeV. Our results show that the calculated ECC increased with increasing value of nuclear deformation."

In this work, we investigate the formation of non-relativistic bound states, involving the P\\\"oschl-Teller potential, in order to discuss the formation time and the thermal equilibrium, applying scales from nuclear physics. This problem is borrowed from the field of heavy-ion collisions, where the deuteron is a probe which is measured at temperature regimes around the chemical freeze out temperature, while the deuteron itself has a binding energy which is much lower. This is known and often described as a ``snowball in hell\".

Many theoretical models suggest that the slope of the symmetry energy controls the development of a neutron skin in neutron-rich nuclei. This led to the expectation that if lead-208 exhibits a large neutron skin, calcium-48 should as well. Given that the PREX collaboration reported a relatively thick neutron skin in lead, we anticipated that calcium would also have a significant neutron skin. Instead, the CREX collaboration reported a thin neutron skin in calcium. Although many suggestions have been proposed, the ``CREX-PREX dilemma\" remains unsolved. Recently, an intriguing scenario has emerged, suggesting that an enhanced isovector spin-orbit interaction could simultaneously account for both results. Following this approach, we performed relativistic mean-field calculations with an increased isovector spin-orbit potential. Our findings indicate that while this modification significantly affects the structure of calcium-48, it has only a marginal impact on lead-208, thereby bringing the results into better agreement with experiment. However, the strong enhancement required to mitigate the CREX-PREX dilemma destroys the agreement with a successful spin-orbit phenomenology, primarily by modifying the well-known ordering of spin-orbit partners."

We find that both the classical and the vacuum polarization energies are linear functions of the topological charge with a small offset. Because the combination of the classical and quantum offsets determines the binding energies, either all higher charge solitons are energetically bound or they are all unbound, depending on model parameters. This linearity persists even when the field configurations are very different from those of isolated solitons, and would not be apparent from an analysis of their bound state spectra alone."

This approach, combining oscillator wave functions and the renormalization factor, is then applied to calculate dipole strength distributions $dB(E1,\\varepsilon)/d\\varepsilon$ and Coulomb dissociation cross section $d\\sigma(E1,\\varepsilon)/d\\varepsilon$ for several $1n$- and $2n$-halo nuclei. The results show excellent agreement with the available experimental data."

Compared to the conventional configuration interaction shell model calculations, the CI-RHF model can be applied to study the structural properties of a wide range of nuclei without readjusting any parameters, because the effective Hamiltonian for different model space can be deduced consistently from a universal density-dependent Lagrangian based on the Hartree-Fock single-particle basis. The convergence of intermediate-state excitations has been examined in evaluating the effective interactions, and the core-polarization effects are illustrated, by using $^{18}$O as an example. Employing the CI-RHF model, both the bulk properties and low-lying spectra of neon isotopes in the $sd$ shell have been well reproduced without introducing additional parameters besides those well-defined in the phenomenological Lagrangian. Moreover, the study of the isotopic evolution of charge radii and low-lying spectra highlights the shell closure at $N=14$ for neon isotopes."

Moreover, we qualitatively analyze the spin alignment from isotropic color fields in the quark gluon plasma phase for comparison.

The properties of quark matter vary with the scaled axion field $a/f_a$ in a periodic manner, with a period of $2\\pi$. Within the range from 0 to $\\pi $, axion field decrease the baryon chemical potential of the first-order phase transition, leading to an increase in normalized pressure and stiffening of the quark matter equation of state. The effect of axions on hybrid star matter that includes the hadron-quark phase transition is contrary to expectations. The axion field shifts the onset of the hadron-quark mixed phase to lower densities but slightly softens the equation of state of the mixed phase matter, which also results in a slight decrease in the maximum mass and corresponding radius of the hybrid stars. However, we also find that the lowering of the onset of the mixed phase significantly increases the radius and mass of the quark-matter core in the hybrid star. Therefore, our results indicate with axion effects, a sizable quark-matter core can appear in $2M_{\\odot}$ massive neutron stars."

A net internal force upon the neutron arises from the chiral weak interactions between its quarks, which results from the simultaneous breaking of parity and time-reversal symmetries by the weak nuclear interaction and the spin polarization of the neutron, respectively. The variation of the neutron's kinetic momentum is accompanied with the transfer of an equivalent linear momentum to the fields of the Z and W-bosons that mediate the interactions, in the opposite direction. The effect is linear in Fermi's constant. Using the simplest hadron models, an upper bound of the order of meters per second is estimated for the velocity variation of the polarized neutron along the spin-flip process."

We study the frame-dependence of full axial-vector four-current distributions for a moving hadron, and compare them with their light-front counterparts. We revisit the role played by the Melosh rotation, and understand more easily and intuitively the origins of distortions appearing in light-front distributions (relative to the Breit frame ones) using the conjecture that we propose in this work. In particular, we show that the second-class current contribution, although explicitly included, does not contribute in fact to the mean-square axial and spin radii.

      "summary": "Collective modes emerge as the relevant degrees of freedom that govern low-energy excitations of atomic nuclei. These modes—rotations, pairing rotations, and vibrations—are separated in energy from non-collective excitations, making it possible to describe them in the framework of effective field theory. Rotations and pairing rotations are the remnants of Nambu–Goldstone modes from the emergent breaking of rotational symmetry and phase symmetries in finite deformed and finite superfluid nuclei, respectively. The symmetry breaking severely constrains the structure of low-energy Lagrangians and thereby clarifies what is essential and simplifies the description. The approach via effective field theories exposes the essence of nuclear collective excitations and is defined with a breakdown scale in mind. This permits one to make systematic improvements and to estimate and quantify uncertainties. Effective field theories of collective excitations have been used to compute spectra, transition rates, and other matrix elements of interest. In particular, predictions of the nuclear matrix element for neutrinoless double beta decay then come with quantified uncertainties. This review summarizes these results and also compares the approach via effective field theories to well-known models and ab initio computations."

The present work may be classified into two main categories. In the first phase, we study the nuclear structure properties of $^{76}$Se using the interacting boson model-1 (IBM-1). The IBM-1 investigations include the energy levels, $B(E2)$ values, and the prediction of the geometry. We performed the extended consistent-Q formalism (ECQF) calculation and later the triaxial formalism calculation (constructed by adding the cubic term to the ECQF). The geometry of $^{76}$Se can be envisioned within the formalism of the potential energy surface based on the classical limit of the IBM-1 model.\n  In the second phase, we reconfirm the unblocking of the Gamow-Teller (GT) strength in $^{76}$Se (a test case for nuclei having $N > 40$ and $Z < 40$). Using the deformed pn-QRPA model, we calculate GT transitions, stellar electron capture cross section (within the limit of low momentum transfer), and stellar weak rates for $^{76}$Se. The distinguishing feature of our calculation is a state-by-state evaluation of stellar weak rates in a fully microscopic fashion. Results are compared with experimental data and previous calculations. The calculated GT distribution fulfills the Ikeda sum rule. Rates for $\\beta$-delayed neutrons and emission probabilities are also calculated. Our study suggests that at high stellar temperatures and low densities, the $\\beta^+$-decay on $^{76}$Se should not be neglected and needs to be taken into consideration along with electron capture rates for simulation of presupernova evolution of massive stars."

They come in two types: [c, c, d] (or [c, ,d, d]) and triples with distinct entries. The first case is related to Pythagorean triples. The distinct curvature case is more involved and needs a combined representations of certain binary quadratic forms of the indefinite and definite type. The degenerate case when a straight line touches the three given touching circles can also be characterized completely."

We measured isotope shifts from optical spectra for nine radioactive ruthenium isotopes 106-114Ru, reaching deep into the mid-shell region. The extracted charge radii are in excellent agreement with predictions from the Brussels-Skyrme-on-a-Grid models that account for the triaxial deformation of nuclear ground states in this region. We show that triaxial deformation impacts charge radii in models that feature shell effects, in contrast to what could be concluded from a liquid drop analysis. This indicates that this exotic type of deformation should not be neglected in regions where it is known to occur, even if its presence cannot be unambiguously inferred through laser spectroscopy."

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) predicts that this growth can be regulated by nonlinear effects, ultimately leading to gluon saturation. Within the color glass condensate framework, nonlinear QCD effects are predicted to suppress and broaden back-to-back angular correlations in collisions involving heavy nuclei. While suppression has been observed in various experiments in $d/p$$+$A collisions compared to $p$$+$$p$ collisions, the predicted broadening remains unobserved. This study investigates the contributions of intrinsic transverse momentum ($k_T$), which is associated with saturation physics, as well as parton showers and transverse motion from fragmentation ($p_T^{\\mathrm{frag}}$), which are not saturation dependent, to the width of the correlation function. Our findings show that the non-saturation dependent effects, especially the initial-state parton shower and $p_T^{\\mathrm{frag}}$, which occur independently of the collision system, smear the back-to-back correlation more than gluon saturation does, making the broadening phenomenon difficult to observe."

In this paper, we estimate the contribution of inelastic channels to the Light - by - Light (LbL) scattering in ultraperipheral collisions of heavy ions (UPHICs), in which one or both of the incident nuclei dissociate ($A A \\to \\gamma \\gamma X Y$ where $X, Y = A, A'$) due to the photon emission. These new mechanisms are related to extra emissions that are rather difficult to identify at the LHC and can be mistakenly interpreted as enhanced $\\gamma \\gamma \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ scattering compared to the Standard Model result. We include processes of coupling of photons to individual nucleons (protons and neutrons) in addition to coherent coupling to the whole nuclei (called standard approach here). Both elastic (nucleon in the ground state) and inelastic (nucleon in an excited state) in the couplings of photons to nucleons are taken into account. The inelastic nucleon fluxes are calculated using CT18qed photon in nucleon PDFs. The inelastic photon fluxes are shown and compared to standard photon fluxes in the nucleus. In addition, we show the ratio of the inelastic corrections to the standard contribution as a function of diphoton invariant mass and photon rapidity difference. We find the maximal effect of the inelastic corrections at $M_{\\gamma \\gamma} \\sim$ 14 GeV for the ATLAS rapidity and transverse momentum acceptance. Furthermore, the inelastic contribution increases gradually with photon rapidity difference. Our results indicate that the inelastic contributions can increase locally by 10-15 \\% the traditional (no nuclear excitation) predictions for the LbL scattering in UPCs."

Recent developments have extended the IMSRG from its standard truncation at the normal-ordered two-body level, the IMSRG(2), to a precision approximation including normal-ordered three-body operators, the IMSRG(3)-$N^7$. This improvement provides a more precise solution to the many-body problem and makes it possible to quantify many-body uncertainties in IMSRG calculations. We explore the structure of $^{44,48,52}$Ca using the IMSRG(3)-$N^7$, focusing on understanding existing discrepancies of the IMSRG(2) to experimental results. We find a significantly better description of the first $2^+$ excitation energy of $^{48}$Ca, improving the description of the shell closure at $N=28$. At the same time, we find that the IMSRG(3)-$N^7$ corrections to charge radii do not resolve the systematic underprediction of the puzzling large charge radius difference between $^{52}$Ca and $^{48}$Ca. We present estimates of many-body uncertainties of IMSRG(2) calculations applicable also to other systems based on the size extensivity of the method."

The best model resulting from that technique utilizes eight physical features to model the difference between experimental atomic binding energy values in AME 2012 and the Duflo Zuker mass model. This resulted in a model that fit the training data with a standard deviation of 17 keV and that has a standard deviation of 92 keV when compared all of the values in the AME 2020.

The pp-baseline is calculated by the FONLL program, which matches the next-to-leading order pQCD calculation with the next-to-leading-log large-$p_T$ resummation. The in-medium propagation of heavy quarks is driven by the modified Langevin equations, which consider both the elastic and inelastic partonic interactions. We propose a method to separate the respective influence of the six factors, such as pp-spectra, the cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects, in-medium energy loss (E-loss), fragmentation functions (FFs), coalescence (Coal), and decay channels, which may contribute to the larger $R_{AA}$ of HFL $\\leftarrow b$ compared to that of HFL $\\leftarrow c$ in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Based on quantitative analysis, we demonstrate that both coalescence hadronization, decay channels and the mass-dependent E-loss play an essential role at $p_T5$ GeV. Furthermore, we explore the path-length dependence of jet quenching by comparing the HFL $R_{AA}$ in two different collision systems. Our investigations show smaller HFL $R_{AA}$ in Pb+Pb than in Xe+Xe within the same centrality bin, consistent with the ALICE data. The longer propagation time and more effective energy loss of heavy quarks in Pb+Pb collisions play critical roles in the stronger yield suppression of the HFL compared to that in Xe+Xe. In addition, we observe a scaling behavior of the HFL $R_{AA}$ in Xe+Xe and Pb+Pb collisions."

Based on a coupled-channel nonrelativistic effective field theory, we classify the near-threshold structures of a symmetry-related two-channel system by studying the evolution of the scattering amplitude line shapes and pole positions with the variation of the single-channel scattering length and channel coupling strength. We show that the evolution of the scattering amplitude line shapes can be understood from the pole trajectories in the complex energy plane, and the pole evolution can be traced back to the renormalization group fixed points. We provide a dictionary of correspondence between the evolution of line shapes and pole trajectories along with varying interaction and channel coupling strengths, which can be used to understand the experimental observations of the near-threshold structures."

The CMS Collaboration's first measurement of the modification to the EEC within single inclusive jets in Pb+Pb collisions relative to p+p collisions reveals a significant enhancement at small angles, which may arise from jet transverse momentum $p_T$ selection biases due to jet energy loss. We investigate the dependence of jet EECs on the flavor of the initiating parton. The EEC distribution of a gluon jet is broader and the peak of transition from perturbative to non-perturbative regime occurs at a larger angle than a quark jet. Such flavor dependence leads to the different EECs for $\\gamma$-jets and single inclusive jets due to their different flavor composition. It is also responsible for a colliding energy dependence of EECs of single inclusive jets at fixed jet energy. We also investigate the impact of flavor composition variation on the $p_T$ dependence of the jet EEC. We further propose that a change in the gluon jet fraction in A+A collisions compared to p+p can also contribute to a non-negligible enhancement of the medium modified EEC at small angles. Using the \\textsc{Jewel} model, we predict the reduction of the gluon jet fraction in A+A collisions and estimate its impact on the EEC."

Taking \\(^{226}\\)Th as a benchmark, we demonstrate the superiority of Fourier shape parametrization over conventional spherical harmonic parametrization: it significantly enhances the convergence of higher-order collective shape parameters by efficiently characterizing extreme nuclear deformations. Consequently, the new framework generates more reasonable elongated configurations, particularly for the scission configurations, and significantly improves the description of charge distribution near the symmetric fission peak. Moreover, the Fourier shape parametrization provides a smooth and well-defined three-dimensional (3D) PES with minimal correlations between degrees of freedom, enabling high-precision 3D dynamical simulations of fission."

      "summary": "arXiv:2503.09324v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: \\textbf{Background:} Nuclear masses of exotic nuclei are important for both nuclear physics and astrophysics. The deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) is capable of providing proper descriptions for exotic nuclei by simultaneously including deformation and continuum effects. The mass table of even-$Z$ nuclei with $8\\le Z\\le 120$ has been established based on the DRHBc theory [ADNDT 158, 101661 (2024)]. \\textbf{Purpose:} This work aims to systematically estimate the masses of odd-$Z$ nuclei based on the available DRHBc results of even-$Z$ nuclei, thereby providing a pseudo DRHBc mass table for all nuclei with $8\\le Z\\le 120$. This mass table can then be employed in the $r$-process studies to investigate the influence of deformation on $r$-process. \\textbf{Method:} The mass of an odd nucleus is expressed as a function of the masses and odd-even mass differences of its neighboring even nuclei, with the odd-even mass difference approximated by the average pairing gap. The $r$-process simulations are carried out using the site-independent classical $r$-process model based on the waiting-point approximation. \\textbf{Results and Conclusions:} The approximation of the odd-even mass difference with the average pairing gap is validated to be effective, by reproducing the masses of even-$Z$ odd-$N$ nuclei calculated by DRHBc. Combining the DRHBc masses of even-$Z$ nuclei and the estimated masses of odd-$Z$, a pseudo DRHBc mass table is established, with the root-mean-square (rms) deviation from available mass data $\\sigma=1.50$ MeV. This pseudo DRHBc mass table is applied to the $r$-process simulation, and the impact of nuclear deformation effects is analyzed. The deformation effects can influence the $r$-process path and thus affect the $r$-process abundance. In particular, the nuclear shape transitions can even lead to the discontinuity of the $r$-process path."

      "summary": "arXiv:2503.09470v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Ground state properties across the entire nuclear chart are described predominantly and very accurately within the density functional theory (DFT). DFT however breaks many symmetries, among them the most important being the translational, rotational and gauge symmetries. The translational symmetry breaking is special, since it is broken for all nuclei, unlike the rotational and gauge symmetries. Here we analyze the center-of-mass (CoM) projection method suggested by \\textcite{Peierls:1957} in 1957, which leads to a many-body wave function consistent with intrinsic translational symmetry, a procedure similar in spirit to those suggested for restoring rotational and gauge symmetries. The magnitude of the CoM correction to the binding energies of nuclei varies between 10 and 7 MeV from light to heavy nuclei, which is significantly larger than the RMS energy error in the Bethe-Weizs\\\"acker mass formula, which is about 3.5 MeV. The CoM energy correction is also larger than the RMS energy deviation achieved in any DFT mass evaluations of the nuclear masses performed so far (without any symmetry restoration or zero-point energy fluctuations), with an energy RMS typically between 2 and 3 MeV. Since energy density functionals are used in many dynamical simulations, albeit so far without symmetry restoration, and also in nuclear structure calculations, it is crucial the improve the quality of the presently used energy density functions by accounting in an uniform manner for the CoM fluctuations."

Taking the hadron resonance gas picture at face value, chemical freeze-out points at a given baryochemical potential provide a lower bound on the possible temperature of the QCD CP. We first verify that the freeze-out data in heavy-ion collisions are well described by a constant energy per particle curve, $E/N = \\rm const$, under strangeness neutrality conditions ($\\mu_S \\neq 0$, $\\mu_Q \\neq 0$). We then evaluate the hypothetical lower bound on the freeze-out curve based on this criterion in the absence of strangeness neutrality ($\\mu_S = 0$, $\\mu_Q = 0$) and confront it with recent predictions on the CP location. We find that recent estimates based on Yang-Lee edge singularities from lattice QCD data on coarse lattices ($N_{\\tau} = 6$) place the CP significantly below the freeze-out curve, hinting at the importance of performing continuum extrapolation within this method. Predictions based on functional methods and holography place the CP slightly above the freeze-out curve, indicating that the QCD CP may be located very close to the chemical freeze-out in A+A collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3.5 \\div 6$ GeV."

However, it allows the study of precursors of nuclear medium effects such as initial-state/final-state interactions (ISI/FSI). In case of hard proton knockout, the deviation of ISI/FSI from the 'standard' values may carry a signal of color transparency. In this regard, it is important to define the 'standard' as precisely as possible. This work continues previous studies within the framework of the Generalized Eikonal Approximation (GEA). The focus is on processes where the participating protons experience multiple soft rescattering on the spectator neutron. It is shown that correct treatment of deviations of the trajectories of outgoing protons from the longitudinal direction leads to a significant modification of partial amplitudes with soft rescattering of two outgoing protons and non-vanishing amplitudes with rescattering of incoming and outgoing protons. The new treatment of multiple rescattering is important in kinematics with a forward spectator neutron."

This work presents the systematic investigations for the ground-state properties and structure evolutions of odd-$A$ transuranium Bk isotopes taking the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum~(DRHBc) with PC-PK1 density functional, in comparison with those by spherical relativistic continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov~(RCHB) theory. The DRHBc calculations offer improved descriptions of the binding energies, closely aligning with the experimental data. The incorporation of deformation effects in DRHBc results in enhanced nuclear binding energies and a notable reduction in $\\alpha$-decay energies. With the rotational corrections further incorporated, the theoretical deviation by DRHBc from the experimental data is further reduced. Based on the two-neutron gap $\\delta_{\\rm 2n}$ and the neutron pairing energy $E_{\\rm pair}^n$, prominent shell closures at $N=184$ and $258$, as well as potential sub-shell structures at $N=142, 150, 162, 178, 218$, and $230$ are exhibited. A quasi-periodic variation among prolate, oblate, and spherical shapes as well as prolate deformation predominance have been shown in the evolutions of the quadrupole deformation. Possible shape coexistence is predicted in $^{331}$Bk with the oblate and prolate minima in close energies, which is further supported by the triaxial relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum~(TRHBc) calculations. The neutron, proton, and charge radii predicted by DRHBc reveal pronounced kink structures at $N=184$ and $258$ in their evolutions with neutron number and compared to those by RCHB, deformation effect significantly enhances the radii of open-shell nuclei."

Still, it is not fully understood yet, how arbitrary systems evolve towards a stationary distribution, which guarantees thermalization in a thermodynamical context, and how to systematically incorporate the variety of assumptions that are made in this approach in order to preserve thermal Gibbs states. Despite these shortcomings, Lindblad dynamics was successfully employed in heavy-ion physics (quarkonia) and also became of interest in quantum-computer applications.\n  In this paper, we consider a problem borrowed from heavy-ion collisions, namely the formation of bound states, as for example the deuteron, in the non-relativistic regime by using the already well understood techniques of Lindblad dynamics. However, only recently, we were able to extend this toolbox by showing, that the position-space Lindblad equation can be reformulated in terms of a diffusion-advection equation with sources and therefore provides a hydrodynamical formulation of a dissipative quantum master equation. Making use of this advanced machinery and insights, we describe the possible formation of a bound state, which is realized by a P\\\"oschl-Teller-like potential, of a particle in interaction with a heat bath in a 1-dim setting. We analyse the possibility of a thermalization and the time-scale of the formation, population and depopulation of the bound state. Finally, we also show an example of a much deeper potential, where we allow for three bound states, just in the spirit of quarkonia. Besides this, we discuss general aspects of open quantum systems, like decoherence, entropy production etc."

During a typical avalanche, about 10 to 20 vortices exit the container in a short period, producing a glitch in the superfluid angular momentum and a localised void in the vorticity. After the glitch, vortices continue to depin and circulate around the vorticity void in a similar manner to that seen in previous point-vortex simulations. We present evidence of collective vortex motion throughout this avalanche process. We also show that the effective Magnus force can be used to predict when and where avalanches will occur. Lastly, we comment on the challenge of extrapolating these results to conditions in real neutron stars, which contain many orders of magnitude more vortices."

In this work, we constrain the solid states of strange-cluster matter, called strangeon matter, as the putative basic units of the ground state of bulk strong matter using a Bayesian statistical method, incorporating the mass and radius measurements of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, and the recent data for the $1.4\\ M_{\\odot}$ pulsar PSR J0437-4715. We also include constraints from gravitational wave events GW170817 and GW190814. Under the prior assumption of a finite number of quarks in a strangeon, $N_{\\rm q}$, our analysis reveals that current mass-radius measurements favor a larger $N_{\\rm q}$. Specifically, the results support the scenario where a strangeon forms a stable bound state with $N_{\\rm q}=18$, symmetric in color, flavor, and spin spaces, compared to the minimum $N_{\\rm q}$ prior. The comparative analyses of the posterior EOS parameter spaces derived from three-parameter model and two-parameter model demonstrate a consistent prediction under identical observational constraints. In particular, our results indicate that the most probable values of the maximum mass are found to be $3.58^{+0.16}_{-0.12}\\ M_{\\odot}$ ($3.65^{+0.18}_{-0.16}\\ M_{\\odot}$) at $90\\%$ confidence level for three-parameter (two-parameter) EOS considering the constraints of GW190814.

Furthermore, we show that the mass and size of the pasta phase core are strongly influenced by the symmetry energy.

Here, we employ the quantum many-body $T$-matrix formalism to evaluate the dissociation rates of heavy quarkonia in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The basic ingredient is the heavy-light $T$-matrix, which utilizes a nonperturbative driving kernel constrained by lattice-QCD data. Its resummation in a ladder series provides a much enhanced interaction strength compared to previously used perturbative coupling to the quasiparticle partons in the QGP. The in-medium quarkonium properties, particularly their temperature-dependent binding energies, are evaluated self-consistently using the same interaction kernel, including interference effects (also referred to as the imaginary part of the heavy-quark potential) as well as off-shell parton spectral functions. We systematically investigate the interplay of these effects and elaborate on the connections to the dipole approximation used in effective field theory."

This study is performed in the hybrid approach SMASH-vHLLE, composed of the hadronic transport approach SMASH and the (3+1)D viscous hydrodynamic code vHLLE. A Bayesian framework is employed, utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to explore the parameter space. The analysis compares model predictions against experimental observables, including particle yields, momentum and flow coefficients both at midrapidity as well as in forward and backward direction. We find that the SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid framework, using hadronic initial conditions for Au+Au collisions at different beam energies, can reproduce a variety of experimental observables at midrapidity and forward/backward rapidities. Notably, the preferred posterior distribution suggests a near-vanishing specific shear viscosity in the high-temperature QGP phase, combined with moderate-to-large bulk viscosity around the phase transition region, although the constraints on baryochemical potential dependence are weak. Our findings reveal that a hadronic initial condition constrains the evolution more strictly at intermediate energies, making parameters such as the hydrodynamic onset time highly sensitive. Intriguingly, the extracted shear viscosity differs substantially from previous Bayesian analyses, motivating further systematic studies with higher-statistics data sets and refined modeling assumptions."

In the description of the finite nuclei with the current RBHF theory, the covariant chiral interactions have to be localized to make calculations feasible. In order to examine the reliability and validity, in this letter, the RBHF theory with local and nonlocal covariant chiral interactions at leading order are applied for nuclear matter. The low-energy constants in the covariant chiral interactions determined with the local regularization are close to those with the nonlocal regularization. Moreover, the RBHF theory with local and nonlocal covariant chiral interactions provide equally well description of the saturation properties of nuclear matter. The present work paves the way for the implementation of covariant chiral interactions in RBHF theory for finite nuclei."

This novel input allows for a consistent description of the $e^+e^-$ data, proton+proton data and finally nucleus-nucleus data at all investigated energies. We conclude that the observed isospin violation in nucleus-nucleus reactions is explained by asymmetric production of up- and down-quarks in the elementary color field fragmentation process."

Two teleportation-like phenomena were predicted by quantum mechanics: quantum teleportation and, recently, quantum particle teleportation. The former is investigated experimentally and has applications in quantum communication and computing.\n  Here, we introduced the third teleportation-like phenomenon - an apparent teleportation. It seems to be a natural consequence of elementary particles and antiparticles of the Standard Model being indistinguishable. We give an example of a process leading to the apparent teleportation within a toy model of boson-like particles. It utilizes the local transport of particles and antiparticles and the local creation and annihilation of particle-antiparticle pairs. Furthermore, we suggest a method to observe the apparent teleportation in nucleus-nucleus collisions at properly selected collision energy. The method requires the measurement of correlations between momenta of charm and anticharm hadrons in collisions with a single $c\\bar{c}$ pair being produced. The ultimate prediction following the apparent teleportation hypothesis is the uncorrelated emission of charm and anticharm hadrons. It can be tested by contemporary experiments.\n  Observing the apparent teleportation would uncover the basic transport properties of indistinguishable particles. In particular, the apparent teleportation may explain the rapid thermalisation of the system created in collisions of two atomic nuclei. Theoretical and experimental efforts are needed to observe the apparent teleportation processes and study their properties."

We distinguish three scattering modes, determined by the magnitude of the momentum transfer, in which particles behave as point-like, structureless extended, and structured composite objects. The results are compared in the potential and QFT approaches of the eikonal model. In the case of proton Coulomb scattering at the LHC the difference between these two approaches is significant. This indicates the unsuitability of the potential approach. However, in the case of Coulomb scattering of heavy nuclei, the leading one is the optical approximation, which formally reproduces the prescription of the potential approach."

Within this model framework, the current quark mass and gluonic quantum contributions to the scale anomaly can be described by the pion and scalar meson masses, respectively, through matching with the underlying QCD. By considering the decomposition of the energy momentum tensor of nucleon, we examine the role of the scale anomaly contributions in the pressure inside the nucleon. As a result, the gluonic scale anomaly is found to dominate the confining pressure. Compared to the result based on the conventional chiral perturbation theory in the chiral limit, our result for the total pressure is capable of qualitatively improving the alignment with lattice QCD observations. Moreover, the pressure from the gluonic scale anomaly is widely distributed in position space, leading to its substantial contribution to the D-term."

This is motivated by the desire to identify lattices for quantum simulations that involve only 3-link vertices among the gauge field group spaces in order to reduce the complexity in applications of the plaquette operator. For the honeycomb lattice, we derive a classically ${\\cal O}(b^2)$-improved Hamiltonian, with $b$ being the lattice spacing. Tadpole improvement via the mean-field value of the plaquette operator is used to provide the corresponding quantum improvements. We have identified the (non-chiral) hyper-honeycomb as a candidate spatial tessellation for 3+1D quantum simulations of gauge theories, and determined the associated ${\\cal O}(b)$-improved Hamiltonian."

We observe that $SU(2)$ Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory does not provide an unambiguous prediction for the sign of the FV correction, which is not surprising when one also considers large-$N_c$ constraints on the axial couplings. We further show that non-monotonic FV corrections are naturally allowed when one considers either including explicit $\\Delta$-resonance degrees of freedom or one works to higher orders in the chiral expansion. We investigate the potential impact of these FV corrections with a precision study of $g_A$ using models of FV corrections that are monotonic and non-monotonic. Using lattice QCD data that is approximately at the 1% level of precision, we do not see significant evidence of non-monotonic corrections. Looking forward to the next phase of lattice QCD calculations, we estimate that calculations that are between the 0.1%-1%-level of precision may be sensitive to these FV artifacts. Finally, we present an update of the CalLat prediction of $g_A$ in the isospin limit with sub-percent precision, $g_A^{\\rm QCD} = 1.2674(96)$."

This study utilizes a multi-phase transport model (AMPT) coupled with PYTHIA8 initial conditions. We have investigated the baryon to meson ratios as well as the strange to non-strange meson ratios varying with the charged particle density. By tuning the coalescence parameters, the AMPT model provides a reasonable description to the experimental data for inclusive productions of both light and charm hadrons, comparable to the string fragmentation model calculations with color reconnection effects. Additionally, we have analyzed the relative production of hadrons by examining self-normalized particle ratios as a function of the charged hadron density. Our findings suggest that parton evolution effects and the coalescence hadronization process in AMPT model lead to a strong flavor hierarchy in the multiplicity dependence of the baryon to meson ratio. Furthermore, our investigation on the $p_T$ differential double ratio of baryon to meson fraction between high and low multiplicity events indicates distinct modifications to the flavor associated baryon to meson ratio $p_T$ shape in high multiplicity events when comparing the coalescence hadronization model to the color reconnection model. These observations highlight the importance of understanding the hadronization process in high-energy proton-proton collisions through a comprehensive multiplicity dependent multi-flavor analysis."

We highlight the importance of diquark correlations in the baryon sector, while for four-quark states such as the light scalar mesons and heavy exotics the dominant two-body clusters are typically mesons.

It also conjectured that generically the scaling will be superlinear (although special cases exist in which it is linear). The quantity $Q_D$ depends only on the properties of ground states along the Hamiltonian path and the rate at which the path is followed. In this paper, we demonstrate that this conjecture holds for simple Hamiltonian systems that can be studied numerically. In particular, the systems studied exhibit the behavior that $Q_D$ grows approximately as $L \\log L$ where $L$ is the path length when the threshold error is fixed."
