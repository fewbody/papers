      "summary": "Author(s): M. Sguazzin et al.The probabilities of an excited atomic nucleus to emit particles and γ rays provide important information on the nuclear level density as well as the γ-ray strength function. These statistical quantities are important to model nuclear reactions including the complex nucleosynthesis networks that have formed the elements that exist today. But these emission probabilities are hard to come by in the laboratory. The authors demonstrate how they have achieved this challenging task with a new experimental approach, by exciting the stable, doubly magic nucleus 208Pb in inelastic proton scattering on a hydrogen gas-jet target inside the Experimental Storage Ring (ESR) at the GSI facility, and by detecting the lead (Pb) beamlike ions instead of the emitted γ rays or neutrons. Such measurements in inverse kinematics in a storage ring are free from complications by, e.g., competing reactions or energy loss in a fixed target. Here, the 208Pb beam passes the low-density hydrogen target a million times per second, restoring the luminosity in the regime of the thin target that preserves pristine excitation-energy resolution and particle identification capability, and enables outstanding detection efficiencies. The present results along with improvements under development promise future results for many short-lived nuclei of interest in astrophysics and nuclear science applications.[Phys. Rev.

Whereas most experiments so far have assumed elastic transitions for muon-to-electron conversion, this paper shows how inelastic transitions which leave the nucleus in an excited state would allow for more probes of new physics. Such transitions can modify the near-endpoint spectrum of conversion electrons, to which the underlying flavor-symmetry violating operator is sensitive. The authors find that 27Al, the target of ongoing muon-to-electron conversion experiments, is an excellent isotope choice to observe inelastic transitions.[Phys. Rev.

      "summary": "Starting from the measurements conducted in 2004 with the ADAMO silicon spectrometer, we have performed a 2D fit procedure to diverse combinations of muon flux datasets documented in the literature. The fit employed three different formulas describing the energy and angular distribution of atmospheric muons at the Earth’s surface. The analysis revealed that some measurements showed discrepancies in their compatibility with the expected results or between them with variations greater than a few sigmas. For example, vertical measurements expand over a wide range of flux values even for similar setup experiments. However, we have identified a formula capable of furnishing comprehensive spectrum coverage utilizing a singular set of parameters. Despite inherent limitations, we have achieved a satisfactory agreement with the Guan parameterization. Subsequently, we have integrated this optimized parameterization into the EcoMug library and a Geant4-based muon generator. The model’s predictive capabilities have been validated by comparing it with experimental flux measurements and against other measurements in the literature. Through this process, we have shown and tested the reliability and accuracy of different muon flux modelling, facilitating advancements in domains reliant on the precise characterization of atmospheric muon phenomena."

      "summary": "Transverse momentum correlations were recently measured by the ALICE collaboration at the LHC [Acharya etal (2020 Phys. Lett. B804 135375)]. A long-range structure in terms of relative pseudorapidity of particle pairs is observed. This may imply some signal of the initial state owing to the sheer spread of the correlation. However, the fluctuations inside a thermally equilibrated medium have to be taken into account, serving as motivation for this paper. Using lattice Quantum Chromodynamics constraints, we predicted the development and spread of balancing correlations caused by energy-momentum conservation. At the same time, we propagated the Gaussian-shaped initial correlation using hydrodynamics to estimate its effects. Our findings suggest that the resulting correlation, known as ‘the ridge,’ is sensitive both to flucutations seeded in the pre-equilibrium stage and to those seeded in the equilibrated medium. This can provide important insight into the early stages of the collision."

As a result, trigger strategies play a key role in extracting relevant information from the vast streams of data produced at facilities like the large hadron collider (LHC). As the energy and luminosity of the collisions increase, these strategies must be upgraded and maintained to suit the experimental needs. This whitepaper presents a high-level overview and reviews recent developments of triggering practices employed at the LHC. The general trigger principles applied at modern HEP experiments are highlighted, with specific reference to the current trigger state-of-the-art within the ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb collaborations. Furthermore, a brief synopsis of the new trigger paradigm required by the upcoming high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC is provided. This whitepaper, compiled by Early Stage Researchers of the SMARTHEP network, is not meant to provide an exhaustive review or substitute documentation and papers from the collaborations themselves, but rather offer general considerations and examples from the literature that are relevant to the SMARTHEP network."

The proposed detector design was simulated using the Geant4 framework, featuring segmented modules of plastic scintillators doped with gadolinium to enhance neutron capture efficiency. Inverse beta decay (IBD) events generated by ERNIE and background events produced by cosmic ray simulations were used to train and test an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model for signal-background discrimination. The model demonstrated high discrimination accuracy for prompt IBD events but encountered challenges with delayed neutron background discrimination due to similarities in neutron capture. Performance comparisons with traditional cut-based analyses highlighted the improved accuracy achieved through machine learning, particularly when utilizing additional event features. This work establishes the potential of gadolinium-doped plastic scintillators and machine learning in enhancing neutrino detection and lays the groundwork for future experimental validation and detector optimization."

      "summary": "We consider a general model for a quasi-spherical explosion in which a part of the explosion energy is thermalized, forming an expanding photosphere around a compact object, and the second part of energy is taken by the expanding shell of material which forms a shock wave in the surrounding medium. Different types of particles (electrons, hadrons) can, in principle, be accelerated at the shock. They interact with the thermal radiation from the photosphere and also with the material at the shell. We determine the equilibrium spectra of particles in the shell as a function of time after explosion and calculate the time-dependent γ-ray spectra by taking into account the effects which are due to the anisotropy of the photo-spheric radiation field on the Inverse Compton (IC) process; we also include the absorption of IC γ-rays in the photosphere radiation. We conclude that, in principle, both leptonic and hadronic models can explain the GeV-TeV gamma-ray emission recently detected from the Nova RS Oph. However, the hadronic model, in comparison to the leptonic model, is more energetically demanding and requires much stronger magnetization of the nova shell."

In this study, we consider two gluon operators for which the hybrid-ratio renormalization matching kernels have been recently derived and a third operator that has been used in prior pseudo-PDF studies of the gluon PDFs. We compare the matrix elements for each operator for both the nucleon and pion, at both pion masses, and using two gauge-smearing techniques. Focusing on the more phenomenologically studied nucleon gluon PDF, we compare the ratio and hybrid-ratio renormalized matrix elements at both pion masses and both smearings to those reconstructed from the nucleon gluon PDF from the CT18 global analysis. We identify the best choice of operator to study the gluon PDF and present the first gluon quasi-PDF under some caveats. Additionally, we explore the recent idea of Coulomb gauge fixing to improve signal at large Wilson-line displacement and find it could be a major help in improving the signal in the gluon matrix elements. This work helps identify the best operator for studying the gluon quasi-PDF, shows higher hadron boost momentum is needed to implement hybrid-ratio renormalization reliably, and suggests the need to study more diverse set of operators with their corresponding perturbative calculations for hybrid-ratio renormalization to further gluon quasi-PDF study."

Precisely measuring their results remains a difficult task in experiments, when employing the centrality bin width correction (CBWC) to suppress the initial volume fluctuations. Various techniques within the CBWC formula can lead to notable differences in the results. We will systematically investigate the application of the CBWC method to the measured net-proton C5/C1 and C6/C2 using the UrQMD model and Skellam-based simulations at = 11.5 GeV in Au + Au collisions. A recommended approach is proposed to calculate C5/C1 and C6/C2 in 0%–40% centrality. With statistics comparable to the RHIC beam energy scan phase II (BES-II), our studies provide a baseline for analyzing net-proton C5/C1 and C6/C2 in relativistic heavy-ion collisions."

Important aspects like energy conservation and effects on particle production and flow are discussed. It is shown, that this new implementation reproduces qualitatively and quantitatively available data over a wide range of beam energies and improves the description of observables without exception. In particular the description of hyperon and pion production at SIS18 energies is improved. From a comparison with HADES data one could conclude that the present parametrization of the CMF model leads to a slightly too weak momentum dependence. However, a more firm conclusion will require a systematic comparison with flow and multiplicity data over a range of beam energies and system sizes. Our work serves as an important step towards such future studies where the properties of dense QCD matter, through parameters of the CMF model, can be constraint using a comparison of the UrQMD model with high precision heavy ion data, finally also allowing direct comparisons with neutron star and neutron star merger observables."

The experiment utilized germanium targets with natural isotopic composition. Irradiation of the targets was performed using a proton beam from the AIC-144 accelerator at the Institute of Nuclear Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Krakow. Gamma spectroscopy was conducted with high-purity germanium detectors to measure the gamma-ray emissions from the irradiated targets. This enabled the determination of reaction cross-sections of the produced radionuclides. Additionally, our results were compared with existing literature and TALYS data to validate our findings. Generally, our experimental results align with previous studies, although discrepancies were observed in certain aspects.

These perturbations include oblateness, triaxiality, radiation pressure, and the effects of Coriolis and centrifugal forces. Recent advancements have shifted focus to systems involving more than three bodies, with notable work in the four-body problem. In this study, we extend the analysis to the five-body problem, examining its chaotic behavior and identifying regions of libration points. By varying the masses of the bodies across distinct surface points, we analyze the system’s dynamics, uncovering fractal zones within the problem. Additionally, we perform a stability analysis of the libration points, offering new insights into the behavior and stability of the five-body system. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of multi-body interactions and their implications in both theoretical and applied contexts."

The study focuses on the low-lying excited doublet states 1$$s^{{2}}$$ns, 1$$s^{{2}}n$$p, and 1$$s^{{2}}n$$d, utilizing plasma potentials such as the screened Coulomb (SCP), exponential cosine screened Coulomb (ECSCP), and Hulthén potentials. Energy eigenvalues are determined using appropriate trial wave functions, which account for electron–electron repulsion and spin parts to adhere to the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Moreover, two factors related to the wave function of the compressed system and ECSCP model are considered. The results reveal an intriguing relative ordering for the lithium atom using the three plasma models, with many of the findings being significant contributions yet to be explored."

On the one hand, after determining the potential parameters according to experimental data, EQS and N–U results are compared to the numerical ones to show the effectiveness of our calculations. On the other hand, the effects of the non-linearity introduced via energy-dependent potentials in the Schrödinger equation are shown through a comparison made between energy-dependent and position-only-dependent cases of the Manning-Rosen potential. We considered some diatomic molecules CO$$^{+}$$, BO, and CN with the experimental values of their potential parameters. Our results allowed us to consider, as a particular case, the three-dimensional energy-dependent Hulthén potential.\n"

To classify the singly heavy pentaquark structures, we employ the special unitary representation. By using the SU(3) flavor representation, singly heavy pentaquark states are classified into the allowed flavor multiplets. Also, by using the extension of the Gursey-Radicati mass formula and the effective mass scheme, masses of singly heavy pentaquark states are estimated. Further, magnetic moments of singly heavy pentaquarks have been calculated using the effective mass and the screened charge schemes. A thorough comparison of our results shows reasonable agreement with the available theoretical data and may be helpful for future experimental studies."

A perturbative treatment of contact terms when solving the three-nucleon (3N) continuum Faddeev equation seems to be particularly well suited to dealing with variable strengths of such components in the chiral 3NF. A significant reduction of the computation time achieved in this way makes such an approach a valuable tool for fine-tuning of the 3N Hamiltonian parameters."

The measurements cover a range of 8–16 MeV for the incident proton beam. The angular distributions of the $$\\gamma $$-rays have been measured. A detailed phenomenological analysis within the framework of optical model formalism has been carried out to reproduce the experimental data. The existing global set of elastic, polarization and total reaction data for protons and neutrons have been used to generate the optical model potential. The nuclear structure effects have been included in the calculations by considering the roles of coupling of the low-lying states, the presence of resonances and nuclear deformations. The potentials so generated have been used to calculate the differential and total cross sections for both (p,p$$^\\prime $$) and (p,p$$^\\prime \\gamma $$) reactions. The results of the analysis are in good agreement with the measured data for the observed $$\\gamma $$-rays. However, discrepancies still exist in reproducing the finer details of the cross sections. The existing discrepancies between our phenomenological analysis and the experimental data demonstrate the rather complex roles of channel couplings, resonances in the compound nuclear system and target deformation. The significant contribution of nuclear structure effects in light mass nucleus like $$^{12}$$C and $$^{16}$$O, leads to an apparent loss of predictive power of the theoretical calculation for low-energy region (less than 10 MeV) of the projectile energy."

A model based on the Eckart potential is introduced for an effective description in the universal window. In this model, the short-range interaction is considered as a whole, similar to how the s-wave phase-shift $$\\delta $$ functions in describing low-energy nucleon–nucleon scattering data. Based on our analysis, we confirm that the obtained parameters accurately represent the characteristics of the short-range physics and the influence of the up-down quark mass difference on the charge symmetry breaking is less significant as initially anticipated. Additionally, we suggest evaluating the charge symmetry breaking of the short-range interaction rather than solely focusing on the nuclear interaction."

Indeed, with the notable exception of a few special cases, their associated Schrödinger equation cannot be solved analytically for more than two particles. One has to resort to approximation methods to tackle quantum few-body problems. In particular, variational methods have been proposed to ease numerical calculations and obtain precise solutions. One such method is the Stochastic Variational Method, which employs a stochastic search to determine the number and parameters of correlated Gaussian basis functions used to construct an ansatz of the wave function. Stochastic methods, however, face numerical and optimization challenges as the number of particles increases.We introduce a family of gradient variational methods that replace stochastic search with gradient optimization. We comparatively and empirically evaluate the performance of the baseline Stochastic Variational Method, several instances of the gradient variational method family, and some hybrid methods for selected few-body problems. We show that gradient and hybrid methods can be more efficient and effective than the Stochastic Variational Method. We discuss the role of singularities, oscillations, and gradient optimization strategies in the performance of the respective methods."

Our findings indicate that the photon sphere and BH shadow radii decrease owing to the quantum correction parameter α, which acts as a repulsive gravitational charge. Further, we investigate the gravitational weak lensing by applying the general formalism used to model the deflection angle of the light traveling around the quantum-corrected BH within the plasma medium. We show, in conjunction with the fact that the combined effects of the quantum correction and non-uniform plasma frequency parameter can decrease the deflection angle, that the light traveling through the uniform plasma can be strongly deflected than the non-uniform plasma environment surrounding the quantum-corrected BH.

Different proximity potentials are used to calculate the decay half-lives of nuclei. The fragmentation potential and preformation distribution suggest that SF is the major contributor up to , and HPR starts competing for heavier nuclei. The heavy cluster emission is supported by Pb-magicity, whereas SF is reinforced owing to the deformations of fission fragments. The heavy cluster decay half-lives (log TC) are calculated using the PCM and are compared with the estimates of the analytical super asymmetric fission (ASAF) model. The calculated log TC values agree well with the ASAF measurements when using the Prox-00 and Mod Prox-00 versions of potentials. However, Prox-77, Prox-88, and Prox-BW-91 are not appropriate to address the log TC for nuclei. To resolve this, we include Z-dependence in the radius parameters. Interestingly, the half-lives match the ASAF data after the inclusion of Z-dependence. The branching ratios are also calculated for superheavy nuclei and compared with the estimates of unified description (UD) formula, universal curve (UNIV), universal decay law (UDL), Horoi formula, and ASAF measurements. Furthermore, the SF half-lives ( ) of Cn, Cn, Fl, and Fl superheavy nuclei are estimated through various proximity potentials. Among them, Prox-00 is appropriate for addressing the experimental data. Using this potential, the SF half-lives are estimated through the PCM for isotopes at different neck-length parameters.

Polytropic EOS, Chandrasekar EOS, and Harrison-Wheeler EOS are employed for calculation. Haensel and Potekhin's unified EOS of neutron-star matter based on FPS and SLy EOSs are used for tests. Bremsstrahlung calculations are tested on existing measurements of bremsstrahlung in the scattering of protons off 197Au nuclei at a proton beam energy of MeV.

The effects of shear viscosity and the sub-nucleon structure on anisotropic flow and flow fluctuation are analyzed. Our result shows that shear viscosity tends to suppress both flow coefficients ( , , and ) and flow fluctuation ( ) owing to its smearing effect on local density fluctuation. The flow coefficients appear to be insensitive to the sub-nucleon structure, whereas the flow fluctuation tends to be suppressed by the sub-nucleon structure in central collisions but enhanced in peripheral collisions. After taking into account the sub-nucleon structure effect, our numerical result can qualitatively describe the relative flow fluctuations ( , ) measured by the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC. We further investigate the effects of shear viscosity, sub-nucleon structure, and initial condition model on the flow angle and flow magnitude decorrelations ( , ) using the four-particle correlation method. We find that the flow decorrelation effect is typically stronger in central collisions than in peripheral collisions. The flow angle decorrelation is found to be insensitive to the shear viscosity and sub-nucleon structure, whereas the flow magnitude decorrelation shows quite different behaviors when using the TRENTO and AMPT initial condition models.

The mirror-skin thickness of $ N = 20 $ isotones and $ Z = 20 $ isotopes is studied by using Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) calculations with various Skyrme EDFs and adding CSB and charge independence breaking (CIB) terms. It is shown that the mirror-skin thickness is sensitive only to the CSB EDF, but hardly depends on either the isospin symmetric part of the nuclear EDF or the CIB term. Therefore, this observable can be used to extract the magnitude of the CSB term in the EDF quantitatively, either from experimental data or ab initio calculations. We have studied the accuracy in the mirror-skin thickness that is needed to extract sensible information. Our study may also help to understand the inconsistency between the strength of the phenomenological CSB and that extracted from ab initio calculations [Naito et al. Nuovo. Cim. C 47, 52 (2024)]. Among possible mirror pairs for experimental study, we propose the mirror-skin thickness between $ {}^{42} \\mathrm{Ca} $ and $ {}^{42} \\mathrm{Ti} $, which could be accessed in future experiments in RIBF and/or FRIB."

PHSD is a microscopic, non-equilibrium approach that integrates hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom, providing a comprehensive description of relativistic heavy-ion collisions from initial nucleon-nucleon interactions to quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation, hadronization, and final-state interactions. Key dilepton sources in PHSD include hadronic decays, bremsstrahlung, QGP radiation ($q+\\bar q \\to e^+e^-$, \\ $q+\\bar q \\to g+ e^+e^-$, \\ $q+g \\to q+ e^+e^-$), primary Drell-Yan production, and semileptonic decays of correlated charm and bottom pairs. PHSD well describes dilepton data from HADES, STAR, and ALICE experiments. We examine in-medium effects, such as the vector meson spectral function broadening, and present the excitation function for the dilepton \"excess\" in the invariant mass range $0.4<0.75$ GeV/c$^2$. For the first time we report on the baryon chemical potential $\\mu_B$-dependence of the QGP radiation calculated on a basis of the Dynamical-Quasi-Particle Model (DQPM) in PHSD. The influence of $\\mu_B$ on the QGP yield grows at lower collision energies, where $\\mu_B$ becomes large, however, its impact on the total dilepton spectra is small due to the lowering of the QGP volume with decreasing energy. The excitation function of QGP dileptons, is presented versus correlated charm, confirming that the QGP radiation overshines charm contributions at $\\sqrt{s} \\simeq 25-30$ GeV in central Au+Au collisions, providing access to thermal QGP dileptons at BES RHIC and FAIR."

This leads to a more realistic description of nuclear partition function which poses one of the largest uncertainties in the mass fraction calculations under conditions of NSE.

The excitation energy spectrum above the $t$+$t$ threshold in $^{6}$He is measured via the fragmentation excitation process during the breakup reaction of $^{9}$Li on a $^{208}$Pb target at an incident energy of 32.7 MeV/nucleon. The resonant states are reconstructed from the final state coincident particles $t$+$t$ using the invariant mass method, while the non-resonant background is estimated using the event mixing method.

To better understand these mechanisms, we use multi-particle correlations to reconstruct jet anisotropies. We simulate data using TennGen as a hydro-like background and combine it with PYTHIA-generated jets, clustering them with the anti-$k_{T}$ algorithm.

Several phase transitions must have occurred in neutron stars as well such as transitions from normal to superfluid/superconducting phases and crust formation. In this work, we extend the superfluid band theory, which has been formulated in our previous work [K. Yoshimura and K. Sekizawa, Phys. Rev. C 109, 065804 (2024)] based on the Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) for superfluid systems, into the finite temperature and finite magnetic field systems. As a result of the finite temperature calculations, we find that the superfluidity of neutrons dissapears at around $k_\\text{B}T=0.6$--$0.9\\,$ MeV, and ``melting'' of nuclear slabs, that is, a structural change into the uniform matter, takes place at around $k_\\text{B}T=2.5$--$4.5\\,$ MeV. We also reveal that these transition temperatures exhibit a systematical dependence on the baryon densities. By turning on the magnetic field, we find that protons' spin gets polarized at around $B=10^{16}\\,$G, whereas neutrons' spin is kept unpolarized on average up to around $B=10^{17}\\,$G. Intriguingly, our microscopic calculations reveal that neutrons' spin is actually polarized locally inside and outside of the slab already at $B\\sim10^{16}\\,$G, while keeping the system unpolarized in total. As a conclusion, we have demonstrated validity and usefulness of the fully self-consistent superfluid nuclear band theory for describing neutron star matter under arbitrary temperature and magnetic field. Critical temperatures and magnetic fields have been predicted for 1) superfluid to normal transition, 2) crust formation, and 3) spin polarization, under conditions relevant to realistic neutron star environments."

Together with the total nucleon density profiles of doubly-magic nuclei obtained from the Skyrme Hartree-Fock calculation, we discuss the spatial distribution of quartet correlations in finite nuclei within the local density approximation. Large quartet condensate fractions are found at the surface region of an atomic nucleus due to the strong neutron-proton attractive interactions responsible for the deuteron formation in vacuum. Moreover, we discuss a possible microscopic origin of the Wigner term in the context of nucleon-quartet scattering in dilute symmetric nuclear matter. The nucleon-quartet scattering effect on the Wigner term is numerically estimated as about one order of magnitude of the total empirical strength, indicating the importance of multi-nucleon clusters in the symmetry energy and mass formula in addition to the neutron-proton pairing."

In this paper we study the effect of nuclear deformation on the computed electron capture cross section on selected even even chromium isotopes (464850Cr). The nuclear deformation parameters were computed using two different theoretical models: Interacting Boson Model (IBM 1) and Macroscopic (Yukawa plus exponential) microscopic (Folded Yukawa) model (Mac mic model). A third value of deformation parameter was adopted from experimental data. We chose the pn QRPA model to perform our calculations. The predictive power of the chosen model was first tested by calculating Gamow Teller (GT) strength distributions of selected fp shell nuclei where measured GT data was available. The calculated GT strength distributions were well fragmented over the energy range 0 12 MeV and were noted to be in decent agreement with experimental data. The total GT strength was found to increase (decrease) with decrease (increase) in the value of deformation parameter for the three chromium isotopes. The computed GT strength distributions satisfied the model independent Ikeda sum rule. The ECC were calculated as a function of the deformation parameter at core temperature 1.0 MeV. Our results show that the calculated ECC increased with increasing value of nuclear deformation."

In this work, we investigate the formation of non-relativistic bound states, involving the P\\\"oschl-Teller potential, in order to discuss the formation time and the thermal equilibrium, applying scales from nuclear physics. This problem is borrowed from the field of heavy-ion collisions, where the deuteron is a probe which is measured at temperature regimes around the chemical freeze out temperature, while the deuteron itself has a binding energy which is much lower. This is known and often described as a ``snowball in hell\".

Many theoretical models suggest that the slope of the symmetry energy controls the development of a neutron skin in neutron-rich nuclei. This led to the expectation that if lead-208 exhibits a large neutron skin, calcium-48 should as well. Given that the PREX collaboration reported a relatively thick neutron skin in lead, we anticipated that calcium would also have a significant neutron skin. Instead, the CREX collaboration reported a thin neutron skin in calcium. Although many suggestions have been proposed, the ``CREX-PREX dilemma\" remains unsolved. Recently, an intriguing scenario has emerged, suggesting that an enhanced isovector spin-orbit interaction could simultaneously account for both results. Following this approach, we performed relativistic mean-field calculations with an increased isovector spin-orbit potential. Our findings indicate that while this modification significantly affects the structure of calcium-48, it has only a marginal impact on lead-208, thereby bringing the results into better agreement with experiment. However, the strong enhancement required to mitigate the CREX-PREX dilemma destroys the agreement with a successful spin-orbit phenomenology, primarily by modifying the well-known ordering of spin-orbit partners."

We find that both the classical and the vacuum polarization energies are linear functions of the topological charge with a small offset. Because the combination of the classical and quantum offsets determines the binding energies, either all higher charge solitons are energetically bound or they are all unbound, depending on model parameters. This linearity persists even when the field configurations are very different from those of isolated solitons, and would not be apparent from an analysis of their bound state spectra alone."

This approach, combining oscillator wave functions and the renormalization factor, is then applied to calculate dipole strength distributions $dB(E1,\\varepsilon)/d\\varepsilon$ and Coulomb dissociation cross section $d\\sigma(E1,\\varepsilon)/d\\varepsilon$ for several $1n$- and $2n$-halo nuclei. The results show excellent agreement with the available experimental data."

Compared to the conventional configuration interaction shell model calculations, the CI-RHF model can be applied to study the structural properties of a wide range of nuclei without readjusting any parameters, because the effective Hamiltonian for different model space can be deduced consistently from a universal density-dependent Lagrangian based on the Hartree-Fock single-particle basis. The convergence of intermediate-state excitations has been examined in evaluating the effective interactions, and the core-polarization effects are illustrated, by using $^{18}$O as an example. Employing the CI-RHF model, both the bulk properties and low-lying spectra of neon isotopes in the $sd$ shell have been well reproduced without introducing additional parameters besides those well-defined in the phenomenological Lagrangian. Moreover, the study of the isotopic evolution of charge radii and low-lying spectra highlights the shell closure at $N=14$ for neon isotopes."

Moreover, we qualitatively analyze the spin alignment from isotropic color fields in the quark gluon plasma phase for comparison.

The properties of quark matter vary with the scaled axion field $a/f_a$ in a periodic manner, with a period of $2\\pi$. Within the range from 0 to $\\pi $, axion field decrease the baryon chemical potential of the first-order phase transition, leading to an increase in normalized pressure and stiffening of the quark matter equation of state. The effect of axions on hybrid star matter that includes the hadron-quark phase transition is contrary to expectations. The axion field shifts the onset of the hadron-quark mixed phase to lower densities but slightly softens the equation of state of the mixed phase matter, which also results in a slight decrease in the maximum mass and corresponding radius of the hybrid stars. However, we also find that the lowering of the onset of the mixed phase significantly increases the radius and mass of the quark-matter core in the hybrid star. Therefore, our results indicate with axion effects, a sizable quark-matter core can appear in $2M_{\\odot}$ massive neutron stars."

A net internal force upon the neutron arises from the chiral weak interactions between its quarks, which results from the simultaneous breaking of parity and time-reversal symmetries by the weak nuclear interaction and the spin polarization of the neutron, respectively. The variation of the neutron's kinetic momentum is accompanied with the transfer of an equivalent linear momentum to the fields of the Z and W-bosons that mediate the interactions, in the opposite direction. The effect is linear in Fermi's constant. Using the simplest hadron models, an upper bound of the order of meters per second is estimated for the velocity variation of the polarized neutron along the spin-flip process."

We study the frame-dependence of full axial-vector four-current distributions for a moving hadron, and compare them with their light-front counterparts. We revisit the role played by the Melosh rotation, and understand more easily and intuitively the origins of distortions appearing in light-front distributions (relative to the Breit frame ones) using the conjecture that we propose in this work. In particular, we show that the second-class current contribution, although explicitly included, does not contribute in fact to the mean-square axial and spin radii.

      "summary": "Collective modes emerge as the relevant degrees of freedom that govern low-energy excitations of atomic nuclei. These modes—rotations, pairing rotations, and vibrations—are separated in energy from non-collective excitations, making it possible to describe them in the framework of effective field theory. Rotations and pairing rotations are the remnants of Nambu–Goldstone modes from the emergent breaking of rotational symmetry and phase symmetries in finite deformed and finite superfluid nuclei, respectively. The symmetry breaking severely constrains the structure of low-energy Lagrangians and thereby clarifies what is essential and simplifies the description. The approach via effective field theories exposes the essence of nuclear collective excitations and is defined with a breakdown scale in mind. This permits one to make systematic improvements and to estimate and quantify uncertainties. Effective field theories of collective excitations have been used to compute spectra, transition rates, and other matrix elements of interest. In particular, predictions of the nuclear matrix element for neutrinoless double beta decay then come with quantified uncertainties. This review summarizes these results and also compares the approach via effective field theories to well-known models and ab initio computations."

The present work may be classified into two main categories. In the first phase, we study the nuclear structure properties of $^{76}$Se using the interacting boson model-1 (IBM-1). The IBM-1 investigations include the energy levels, $B(E2)$ values, and the prediction of the geometry. We performed the extended consistent-Q formalism (ECQF) calculation and later the triaxial formalism calculation (constructed by adding the cubic term to the ECQF). The geometry of $^{76}$Se can be envisioned within the formalism of the potential energy surface based on the classical limit of the IBM-1 model.\n  In the second phase, we reconfirm the unblocking of the Gamow-Teller (GT) strength in $^{76}$Se (a test case for nuclei having $N > 40$ and $Z < 40$). Using the deformed pn-QRPA model, we calculate GT transitions, stellar electron capture cross section (within the limit of low momentum transfer), and stellar weak rates for $^{76}$Se. The distinguishing feature of our calculation is a state-by-state evaluation of stellar weak rates in a fully microscopic fashion. Results are compared with experimental data and previous calculations. The calculated GT distribution fulfills the Ikeda sum rule. Rates for $\\beta$-delayed neutrons and emission probabilities are also calculated. Our study suggests that at high stellar temperatures and low densities, the $\\beta^+$-decay on $^{76}$Se should not be neglected and needs to be taken into consideration along with electron capture rates for simulation of presupernova evolution of massive stars."

They come in two types: [c, c, d] (or [c, ,d, d]) and triples with distinct entries. The first case is related to Pythagorean triples. The distinct curvature case is more involved and needs a combined representations of certain binary quadratic forms of the indefinite and definite type. The degenerate case when a straight line touches the three given touching circles can also be characterized completely."

We measured isotope shifts from optical spectra for nine radioactive ruthenium isotopes 106-114Ru, reaching deep into the mid-shell region. The extracted charge radii are in excellent agreement with predictions from the Brussels-Skyrme-on-a-Grid models that account for the triaxial deformation of nuclear ground states in this region. We show that triaxial deformation impacts charge radii in models that feature shell effects, in contrast to what could be concluded from a liquid drop analysis. This indicates that this exotic type of deformation should not be neglected in regions where it is known to occur, even if its presence cannot be unambiguously inferred through laser spectroscopy."

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) predicts that this growth can be regulated by nonlinear effects, ultimately leading to gluon saturation. Within the color glass condensate framework, nonlinear QCD effects are predicted to suppress and broaden back-to-back angular correlations in collisions involving heavy nuclei. While suppression has been observed in various experiments in $d/p$$+$A collisions compared to $p$$+$$p$ collisions, the predicted broadening remains unobserved. This study investigates the contributions of intrinsic transverse momentum ($k_T$), which is associated with saturation physics, as well as parton showers and transverse motion from fragmentation ($p_T^{\\mathrm{frag}}$), which are not saturation dependent, to the width of the correlation function. Our findings show that the non-saturation dependent effects, especially the initial-state parton shower and $p_T^{\\mathrm{frag}}$, which occur independently of the collision system, smear the back-to-back correlation more than gluon saturation does, making the broadening phenomenon difficult to observe."

In this paper, we estimate the contribution of inelastic channels to the Light - by - Light (LbL) scattering in ultraperipheral collisions of heavy ions (UPHICs), in which one or both of the incident nuclei dissociate ($A A \\to \\gamma \\gamma X Y$ where $X, Y = A, A'$) due to the photon emission. These new mechanisms are related to extra emissions that are rather difficult to identify at the LHC and can be mistakenly interpreted as enhanced $\\gamma \\gamma \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ scattering compared to the Standard Model result. We include processes of coupling of photons to individual nucleons (protons and neutrons) in addition to coherent coupling to the whole nuclei (called standard approach here). Both elastic (nucleon in the ground state) and inelastic (nucleon in an excited state) in the couplings of photons to nucleons are taken into account. The inelastic nucleon fluxes are calculated using CT18qed photon in nucleon PDFs. The inelastic photon fluxes are shown and compared to standard photon fluxes in the nucleus. In addition, we show the ratio of the inelastic corrections to the standard contribution as a function of diphoton invariant mass and photon rapidity difference. We find the maximal effect of the inelastic corrections at $M_{\\gamma \\gamma} \\sim$ 14 GeV for the ATLAS rapidity and transverse momentum acceptance. Furthermore, the inelastic contribution increases gradually with photon rapidity difference. Our results indicate that the inelastic contributions can increase locally by 10-15 \\% the traditional (no nuclear excitation) predictions for the LbL scattering in UPCs."

Recent developments have extended the IMSRG from its standard truncation at the normal-ordered two-body level, the IMSRG(2), to a precision approximation including normal-ordered three-body operators, the IMSRG(3)-$N^7$. This improvement provides a more precise solution to the many-body problem and makes it possible to quantify many-body uncertainties in IMSRG calculations. We explore the structure of $^{44,48,52}$Ca using the IMSRG(3)-$N^7$, focusing on understanding existing discrepancies of the IMSRG(2) to experimental results. We find a significantly better description of the first $2^+$ excitation energy of $^{48}$Ca, improving the description of the shell closure at $N=28$. At the same time, we find that the IMSRG(3)-$N^7$ corrections to charge radii do not resolve the systematic underprediction of the puzzling large charge radius difference between $^{52}$Ca and $^{48}$Ca. We present estimates of many-body uncertainties of IMSRG(2) calculations applicable also to other systems based on the size extensivity of the method."

The best model resulting from that technique utilizes eight physical features to model the difference between experimental atomic binding energy values in AME 2012 and the Duflo Zuker mass model. This resulted in a model that fit the training data with a standard deviation of 17 keV and that has a standard deviation of 92 keV when compared all of the values in the AME 2020.

The pp-baseline is calculated by the FONLL program, which matches the next-to-leading order pQCD calculation with the next-to-leading-log large-$p_T$ resummation. The in-medium propagation of heavy quarks is driven by the modified Langevin equations, which consider both the elastic and inelastic partonic interactions. We propose a method to separate the respective influence of the six factors, such as pp-spectra, the cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects, in-medium energy loss (E-loss), fragmentation functions (FFs), coalescence (Coal), and decay channels, which may contribute to the larger $R_{AA}$ of HFL $\\leftarrow b$ compared to that of HFL $\\leftarrow c$ in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Based on quantitative analysis, we demonstrate that both coalescence hadronization, decay channels and the mass-dependent E-loss play an essential role at $p_T5$ GeV. Furthermore, we explore the path-length dependence of jet quenching by comparing the HFL $R_{AA}$ in two different collision systems. Our investigations show smaller HFL $R_{AA}$ in Pb+Pb than in Xe+Xe within the same centrality bin, consistent with the ALICE data. The longer propagation time and more effective energy loss of heavy quarks in Pb+Pb collisions play critical roles in the stronger yield suppression of the HFL compared to that in Xe+Xe. In addition, we observe a scaling behavior of the HFL $R_{AA}$ in Xe+Xe and Pb+Pb collisions."

Based on a coupled-channel nonrelativistic effective field theory, we classify the near-threshold structures of a symmetry-related two-channel system by studying the evolution of the scattering amplitude line shapes and pole positions with the variation of the single-channel scattering length and channel coupling strength. We show that the evolution of the scattering amplitude line shapes can be understood from the pole trajectories in the complex energy plane, and the pole evolution can be traced back to the renormalization group fixed points. We provide a dictionary of correspondence between the evolution of line shapes and pole trajectories along with varying interaction and channel coupling strengths, which can be used to understand the experimental observations of the near-threshold structures."

The CMS Collaboration's first measurement of the modification to the EEC within single inclusive jets in Pb+Pb collisions relative to p+p collisions reveals a significant enhancement at small angles, which may arise from jet transverse momentum $p_T$ selection biases due to jet energy loss. We investigate the dependence of jet EECs on the flavor of the initiating parton. The EEC distribution of a gluon jet is broader and the peak of transition from perturbative to non-perturbative regime occurs at a larger angle than a quark jet. Such flavor dependence leads to the different EECs for $\\gamma$-jets and single inclusive jets due to their different flavor composition. It is also responsible for a colliding energy dependence of EECs of single inclusive jets at fixed jet energy. We also investigate the impact of flavor composition variation on the $p_T$ dependence of the jet EEC. We further propose that a change in the gluon jet fraction in A+A collisions compared to p+p can also contribute to a non-negligible enhancement of the medium modified EEC at small angles. Using the \\textsc{Jewel} model, we predict the reduction of the gluon jet fraction in A+A collisions and estimate its impact on the EEC."

Taking \\(^{226}\\)Th as a benchmark, we demonstrate the superiority of Fourier shape parametrization over conventional spherical harmonic parametrization: it significantly enhances the convergence of higher-order collective shape parameters by efficiently characterizing extreme nuclear deformations. Consequently, the new framework generates more reasonable elongated configurations, particularly for the scission configurations, and significantly improves the description of charge distribution near the symmetric fission peak. Moreover, the Fourier shape parametrization provides a smooth and well-defined three-dimensional (3D) PES with minimal correlations between degrees of freedom, enabling high-precision 3D dynamical simulations of fission."

      "summary": "arXiv:2503.09324v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: \\textbf{Background:} Nuclear masses of exotic nuclei are important for both nuclear physics and astrophysics. The deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) is capable of providing proper descriptions for exotic nuclei by simultaneously including deformation and continuum effects. The mass table of even-$Z$ nuclei with $8\\le Z\\le 120$ has been established based on the DRHBc theory [ADNDT 158, 101661 (2024)]. \\textbf{Purpose:} This work aims to systematically estimate the masses of odd-$Z$ nuclei based on the available DRHBc results of even-$Z$ nuclei, thereby providing a pseudo DRHBc mass table for all nuclei with $8\\le Z\\le 120$. This mass table can then be employed in the $r$-process studies to investigate the influence of deformation on $r$-process. \\textbf{Method:} The mass of an odd nucleus is expressed as a function of the masses and odd-even mass differences of its neighboring even nuclei, with the odd-even mass difference approximated by the average pairing gap. The $r$-process simulations are carried out using the site-independent classical $r$-process model based on the waiting-point approximation. \\textbf{Results and Conclusions:} The approximation of the odd-even mass difference with the average pairing gap is validated to be effective, by reproducing the masses of even-$Z$ odd-$N$ nuclei calculated by DRHBc. Combining the DRHBc masses of even-$Z$ nuclei and the estimated masses of odd-$Z$, a pseudo DRHBc mass table is established, with the root-mean-square (rms) deviation from available mass data $\\sigma=1.50$ MeV. This pseudo DRHBc mass table is applied to the $r$-process simulation, and the impact of nuclear deformation effects is analyzed. The deformation effects can influence the $r$-process path and thus affect the $r$-process abundance. In particular, the nuclear shape transitions can even lead to the discontinuity of the $r$-process path."

      "summary": "arXiv:2503.09470v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Ground state properties across the entire nuclear chart are described predominantly and very accurately within the density functional theory (DFT). DFT however breaks many symmetries, among them the most important being the translational, rotational and gauge symmetries. The translational symmetry breaking is special, since it is broken for all nuclei, unlike the rotational and gauge symmetries. Here we analyze the center-of-mass (CoM) projection method suggested by \\textcite{Peierls:1957} in 1957, which leads to a many-body wave function consistent with intrinsic translational symmetry, a procedure similar in spirit to those suggested for restoring rotational and gauge symmetries. The magnitude of the CoM correction to the binding energies of nuclei varies between 10 and 7 MeV from light to heavy nuclei, which is significantly larger than the RMS energy error in the Bethe-Weizs\\\"acker mass formula, which is about 3.5 MeV. The CoM energy correction is also larger than the RMS energy deviation achieved in any DFT mass evaluations of the nuclear masses performed so far (without any symmetry restoration or zero-point energy fluctuations), with an energy RMS typically between 2 and 3 MeV. Since energy density functionals are used in many dynamical simulations, albeit so far without symmetry restoration, and also in nuclear structure calculations, it is crucial the improve the quality of the presently used energy density functions by accounting in an uniform manner for the CoM fluctuations."

Taking the hadron resonance gas picture at face value, chemical freeze-out points at a given baryochemical potential provide a lower bound on the possible temperature of the QCD CP. We first verify that the freeze-out data in heavy-ion collisions are well described by a constant energy per particle curve, $E/N = \\rm const$, under strangeness neutrality conditions ($\\mu_S \\neq 0$, $\\mu_Q \\neq 0$). We then evaluate the hypothetical lower bound on the freeze-out curve based on this criterion in the absence of strangeness neutrality ($\\mu_S = 0$, $\\mu_Q = 0$) and confront it with recent predictions on the CP location. We find that recent estimates based on Yang-Lee edge singularities from lattice QCD data on coarse lattices ($N_{\\tau} = 6$) place the CP significantly below the freeze-out curve, hinting at the importance of performing continuum extrapolation within this method. Predictions based on functional methods and holography place the CP slightly above the freeze-out curve, indicating that the QCD CP may be located very close to the chemical freeze-out in A+A collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3.5 \\div 6$ GeV."

However, it allows the study of precursors of nuclear medium effects such as initial-state/final-state interactions (ISI/FSI). In case of hard proton knockout, the deviation of ISI/FSI from the 'standard' values may carry a signal of color transparency. In this regard, it is important to define the 'standard' as precisely as possible. This work continues previous studies within the framework of the Generalized Eikonal Approximation (GEA). The focus is on processes where the participating protons experience multiple soft rescattering on the spectator neutron. It is shown that correct treatment of deviations of the trajectories of outgoing protons from the longitudinal direction leads to a significant modification of partial amplitudes with soft rescattering of two outgoing protons and non-vanishing amplitudes with rescattering of incoming and outgoing protons. The new treatment of multiple rescattering is important in kinematics with a forward spectator neutron."

This work presents the systematic investigations for the ground-state properties and structure evolutions of odd-$A$ transuranium Bk isotopes taking the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum~(DRHBc) with PC-PK1 density functional, in comparison with those by spherical relativistic continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov~(RCHB) theory. The DRHBc calculations offer improved descriptions of the binding energies, closely aligning with the experimental data. The incorporation of deformation effects in DRHBc results in enhanced nuclear binding energies and a notable reduction in $\\alpha$-decay energies. With the rotational corrections further incorporated, the theoretical deviation by DRHBc from the experimental data is further reduced. Based on the two-neutron gap $\\delta_{\\rm 2n}$ and the neutron pairing energy $E_{\\rm pair}^n$, prominent shell closures at $N=184$ and $258$, as well as potential sub-shell structures at $N=142, 150, 162, 178, 218$, and $230$ are exhibited. A quasi-periodic variation among prolate, oblate, and spherical shapes as well as prolate deformation predominance have been shown in the evolutions of the quadrupole deformation. Possible shape coexistence is predicted in $^{331}$Bk with the oblate and prolate minima in close energies, which is further supported by the triaxial relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum~(TRHBc) calculations. The neutron, proton, and charge radii predicted by DRHBc reveal pronounced kink structures at $N=184$ and $258$ in their evolutions with neutron number and compared to those by RCHB, deformation effect significantly enhances the radii of open-shell nuclei."

Still, it is not fully understood yet, how arbitrary systems evolve towards a stationary distribution, which guarantees thermalization in a thermodynamical context, and how to systematically incorporate the variety of assumptions that are made in this approach in order to preserve thermal Gibbs states. Despite these shortcomings, Lindblad dynamics was successfully employed in heavy-ion physics (quarkonia) and also became of interest in quantum-computer applications.\n  In this paper, we consider a problem borrowed from heavy-ion collisions, namely the formation of bound states, as for example the deuteron, in the non-relativistic regime by using the already well understood techniques of Lindblad dynamics. However, only recently, we were able to extend this toolbox by showing, that the position-space Lindblad equation can be reformulated in terms of a diffusion-advection equation with sources and therefore provides a hydrodynamical formulation of a dissipative quantum master equation. Making use of this advanced machinery and insights, we describe the possible formation of a bound state, which is realized by a P\\\"oschl-Teller-like potential, of a particle in interaction with a heat bath in a 1-dim setting. We analyse the possibility of a thermalization and the time-scale of the formation, population and depopulation of the bound state. Finally, we also show an example of a much deeper potential, where we allow for three bound states, just in the spirit of quarkonia. Besides this, we discuss general aspects of open quantum systems, like decoherence, entropy production etc."

During a typical avalanche, about 10 to 20 vortices exit the container in a short period, producing a glitch in the superfluid angular momentum and a localised void in the vorticity. After the glitch, vortices continue to depin and circulate around the vorticity void in a similar manner to that seen in previous point-vortex simulations. We present evidence of collective vortex motion throughout this avalanche process. We also show that the effective Magnus force can be used to predict when and where avalanches will occur. Lastly, we comment on the challenge of extrapolating these results to conditions in real neutron stars, which contain many orders of magnitude more vortices."

In this work, we constrain the solid states of strange-cluster matter, called strangeon matter, as the putative basic units of the ground state of bulk strong matter using a Bayesian statistical method, incorporating the mass and radius measurements of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, and the recent data for the $1.4\\ M_{\\odot}$ pulsar PSR J0437-4715. We also include constraints from gravitational wave events GW170817 and GW190814. Under the prior assumption of a finite number of quarks in a strangeon, $N_{\\rm q}$, our analysis reveals that current mass-radius measurements favor a larger $N_{\\rm q}$. Specifically, the results support the scenario where a strangeon forms a stable bound state with $N_{\\rm q}=18$, symmetric in color, flavor, and spin spaces, compared to the minimum $N_{\\rm q}$ prior. The comparative analyses of the posterior EOS parameter spaces derived from three-parameter model and two-parameter model demonstrate a consistent prediction under identical observational constraints. In particular, our results indicate that the most probable values of the maximum mass are found to be $3.58^{+0.16}_{-0.12}\\ M_{\\odot}$ ($3.65^{+0.18}_{-0.16}\\ M_{\\odot}$) at $90\\%$ confidence level for three-parameter (two-parameter) EOS considering the constraints of GW190814.

Furthermore, we show that the mass and size of the pasta phase core are strongly influenced by the symmetry energy.

Here, we employ the quantum many-body $T$-matrix formalism to evaluate the dissociation rates of heavy quarkonia in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The basic ingredient is the heavy-light $T$-matrix, which utilizes a nonperturbative driving kernel constrained by lattice-QCD data. Its resummation in a ladder series provides a much enhanced interaction strength compared to previously used perturbative coupling to the quasiparticle partons in the QGP. The in-medium quarkonium properties, particularly their temperature-dependent binding energies, are evaluated self-consistently using the same interaction kernel, including interference effects (also referred to as the imaginary part of the heavy-quark potential) as well as off-shell parton spectral functions. We systematically investigate the interplay of these effects and elaborate on the connections to the dipole approximation used in effective field theory."

This study is performed in the hybrid approach SMASH-vHLLE, composed of the hadronic transport approach SMASH and the (3+1)D viscous hydrodynamic code vHLLE. A Bayesian framework is employed, utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to explore the parameter space. The analysis compares model predictions against experimental observables, including particle yields, momentum and flow coefficients both at midrapidity as well as in forward and backward direction. We find that the SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid framework, using hadronic initial conditions for Au+Au collisions at different beam energies, can reproduce a variety of experimental observables at midrapidity and forward/backward rapidities. Notably, the preferred posterior distribution suggests a near-vanishing specific shear viscosity in the high-temperature QGP phase, combined with moderate-to-large bulk viscosity around the phase transition region, although the constraints on baryochemical potential dependence are weak. Our findings reveal that a hadronic initial condition constrains the evolution more strictly at intermediate energies, making parameters such as the hydrodynamic onset time highly sensitive. Intriguingly, the extracted shear viscosity differs substantially from previous Bayesian analyses, motivating further systematic studies with higher-statistics data sets and refined modeling assumptions."

In the description of the finite nuclei with the current RBHF theory, the covariant chiral interactions have to be localized to make calculations feasible. In order to examine the reliability and validity, in this letter, the RBHF theory with local and nonlocal covariant chiral interactions at leading order are applied for nuclear matter. The low-energy constants in the covariant chiral interactions determined with the local regularization are close to those with the nonlocal regularization. Moreover, the RBHF theory with local and nonlocal covariant chiral interactions provide equally well description of the saturation properties of nuclear matter. The present work paves the way for the implementation of covariant chiral interactions in RBHF theory for finite nuclei."

This novel input allows for a consistent description of the $e^+e^-$ data, proton+proton data and finally nucleus-nucleus data at all investigated energies. We conclude that the observed isospin violation in nucleus-nucleus reactions is explained by asymmetric production of up- and down-quarks in the elementary color field fragmentation process."

Two teleportation-like phenomena were predicted by quantum mechanics: quantum teleportation and, recently, quantum particle teleportation. The former is investigated experimentally and has applications in quantum communication and computing.\n  Here, we introduced the third teleportation-like phenomenon - an apparent teleportation. It seems to be a natural consequence of elementary particles and antiparticles of the Standard Model being indistinguishable. We give an example of a process leading to the apparent teleportation within a toy model of boson-like particles. It utilizes the local transport of particles and antiparticles and the local creation and annihilation of particle-antiparticle pairs. Furthermore, we suggest a method to observe the apparent teleportation in nucleus-nucleus collisions at properly selected collision energy. The method requires the measurement of correlations between momenta of charm and anticharm hadrons in collisions with a single $c\\bar{c}$ pair being produced. The ultimate prediction following the apparent teleportation hypothesis is the uncorrelated emission of charm and anticharm hadrons. It can be tested by contemporary experiments.\n  Observing the apparent teleportation would uncover the basic transport properties of indistinguishable particles. In particular, the apparent teleportation may explain the rapid thermalisation of the system created in collisions of two atomic nuclei. Theoretical and experimental efforts are needed to observe the apparent teleportation processes and study their properties."

We distinguish three scattering modes, determined by the magnitude of the momentum transfer, in which particles behave as point-like, structureless extended, and structured composite objects. The results are compared in the potential and QFT approaches of the eikonal model. In the case of proton Coulomb scattering at the LHC the difference between these two approaches is significant. This indicates the unsuitability of the potential approach. However, in the case of Coulomb scattering of heavy nuclei, the leading one is the optical approximation, which formally reproduces the prescription of the potential approach."

Within this model framework, the current quark mass and gluonic quantum contributions to the scale anomaly can be described by the pion and scalar meson masses, respectively, through matching with the underlying QCD. By considering the decomposition of the energy momentum tensor of nucleon, we examine the role of the scale anomaly contributions in the pressure inside the nucleon. As a result, the gluonic scale anomaly is found to dominate the confining pressure. Compared to the result based on the conventional chiral perturbation theory in the chiral limit, our result for the total pressure is capable of qualitatively improving the alignment with lattice QCD observations. Moreover, the pressure from the gluonic scale anomaly is widely distributed in position space, leading to its substantial contribution to the D-term."

This is motivated by the desire to identify lattices for quantum simulations that involve only 3-link vertices among the gauge field group spaces in order to reduce the complexity in applications of the plaquette operator. For the honeycomb lattice, we derive a classically ${\\cal O}(b^2)$-improved Hamiltonian, with $b$ being the lattice spacing. Tadpole improvement via the mean-field value of the plaquette operator is used to provide the corresponding quantum improvements.

We observe that $SU(2)$ Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory does not provide an unambiguous prediction for the sign of the FV correction, which is not surprising when one also considers large-$N_c$ constraints on the axial couplings. We further show that non-monotonic FV corrections are naturally allowed when one considers either including explicit $\\Delta$-resonance degrees of freedom or one works to higher orders in the chiral expansion. We investigate the potential impact of these FV corrections with a precision study of $g_A$ using models of FV corrections that are monotonic and non-monotonic. Using lattice QCD data that is approximately at the 1% level of precision, we do not see significant evidence of non-monotonic corrections. Looking forward to the next phase of lattice QCD calculations, we estimate that calculations that are between the 0.1%-1%-level of precision may be sensitive to these FV artifacts. Finally, we present an update of the CalLat prediction of $g_A$ in the isospin limit with sub-percent precision, $g_A^{\\rm QCD} = 1.2674(96)$."

This study utilizes a multi-phase transport model (AMPT) coupled with PYTHIA8 initial conditions. We have investigated the baryon to meson ratios as well as the strange to non-strange meson ratios varying with the charged particle density. By tuning the coalescence parameters, the AMPT model provides a reasonable description to the experimental data for inclusive productions of both light and charm hadrons, comparable to the string fragmentation model calculations with color reconnection effects. Additionally, we have analyzed the relative production of hadrons by examining self-normalized particle ratios as a function of the charged hadron density. Our findings suggest that parton evolution effects and the coalescence hadronization process in AMPT model lead to a strong flavor hierarchy in the multiplicity dependence of the baryon to meson ratio. Furthermore, our investigation on the $p_T$ differential double ratio of baryon to meson fraction between high and low multiplicity events indicates distinct modifications to the flavor associated baryon to meson ratio $p_T$ shape in high multiplicity events when comparing the coalescence hadronization model to the color reconnection model. These observations highlight the importance of understanding the hadronization process in high-energy proton-proton collisions through a comprehensive multiplicity dependent multi-flavor analysis."

It also conjectured that generically the scaling will be superlinear (although special cases exist in which it is linear). The quantity $Q_D$ depends only on the properties of ground states along the Hamiltonian path and the rate at which the path is followed. In this paper, we demonstrate that this conjecture holds for simple Hamiltonian systems that can be studied numerically. In particular, the systems studied exhibit the behavior that $Q_D$ grows approximately as $L \\log L$ where $L$ is the path length when the threshold error is fixed."

The isotopes have astrophysical significance during the presupernova evolution of massive stars. The energy rates are calculated using the pn QRPA model and compared with the independent particle model (IPM), large scale shell model (LSSM) and recent shell model calculation (GXPF1J). The reported (anti)neutrino cooling rates are smaller by up to two orders of magnitude at low core temperature values than the IPM rates. The two calculations compare well at T = 30 GK. The comparison of cooling rates with the LSSM is interesting. The pn QRPA cooling rates due to even even Fe isotopes are smaller (up to 2 orders of magnitude). For the odd A isotopes, the reported rates are bigger up to an order of magnitude. The pn QRPA computed cooling rates are, up to 2 orders of magnitude, bigger when compared with the GXPF1J calculation. The {\\gamma} ray heating rates due to electron capture rates rise with the temperature and density values of the stellar core. On the other hand, the {\\gamma} ray heating due to \\b{eta} decay increases with the core temperature values but decreases by orders of magnitude when the stellar core stiffens. The pn QRPA computed {\\gamma} heating rates are bigger (up to 3 orders of magnitude) at high temperatures and densities (for the case of 55 56Fe) when compared with the recent shell model results. Owing to the importance of energy rates, this study may contribute to a realistic simulation of presupernova evolution of massive stars."

The half-lives of cluster radioactivity and alpha decay of 41 atomic nuclei ranging from 221Fr to 244Cm were calculated, and the results indicate that the refined nuclear potential named BW91 is the most suitable proximity potential form for the cluster radioactivity and alpha decay of superheavy nuclei since the root-mean-square (RMS) deviation between the experimental data and the relevant theoretical calculation results is the smallest ({\\sigma}= 0.841).

We employ the Langevin model and the Instantaneous Coalescence Model (LICM), coupled with hydrodynamic simulations, to study charm quark diffusion and coalescence into the $\\Omega_{ccc}$ baryon in expanding QCD matter. The thermal production of the $\\Omega_{ccc}$ is governed by the charm quark densities and the in-medium wavefunctions of the $\\Omega_{ccc}$, which determines the coalescence probability for the three charm quarks. We calculate the $\\Omega_{ccc}$ production with realistic charm diffusions and different in-medium wave functions of $\\Omega_{ccc}$ baryon.

We also identify universal relations linking global properties of strange quark stars - specifically, their moment of inertia, tidal deformability, and both gravitational and baryonic compactness. Remarkably, these relations hold for two substantially different microscopic models - the quark-mass density-dependent model with excluded-volume corrections and the vector MIT bag model - underscoring their robust, model-independent nature. We demonstrate that the universal relations for strange quark stars differ significantly from those previously established for neutron stars composed of hadronic matter, thus enabling discrimination between the two types of objects without requiring detailed knowledge of their equations of state. Moreover, observational constraints on the maximum mass of compact stars could place bounds on both the depth of quark-matter self-binding and the strength of quark repulsive interactions."

The UPC cross sections are computed in the equivalent photon approximation with realistic photon fluxes from the charged form factors of proton, lead, gold, and nitrogen ions. The production of four types of even-spin systems are considered: quarkonium (spin-0,2,4 meson bound states, from the lightest $\\pi^0$ meson up to toponium), exotic hadrons (including candidate multiquark states), leptonium (positronium, dimuonium, and ditauonium), as well as mesonium (pionium, kaonium, D-onia, and B-onia) and baryonium (notably, protonium) QED atoms. The expected yields at the different colliders are presented for about 50 such even-spin composite resonances, for which the ALICE and LHCb experiments have potential reconstruction capabilities at the LHC. The impact of the diphoton decays of such even-spin states is also discussed as resonant backgrounds in the measurement of light-by-light scattering ($\\gamma\\gamma\\to\\gamma\\gamma$) over $m_{\\gamma\\gamma} = 0.1$--15 GeV in PbPb UPCs at the LHC."

The models have been trained on a subset of AME 2012 data and have been verified with a subset of the AME 2020 data. Among the machine learning approaches tested in this work, the preferred approach is the least squares boosted ensemble of trees which appears to have a superior ability to both interpolate and extrapolate binding energy residuals. The machine learning models for four mass models created from the ensemble of trees approach have been combined to create a composite model called the Four Model Tree Ensemble (FMTE). The FMTE model predicts binding energy values from AME 2020 with a standard deviation of 76 keV and a mean deviation of 34 keV for all nuclei with N > 7 and Z > 7. A comparison with new mass measurements for 33 isotopes not included in AME 2012 or AME 2020 indicates that the FMTE performs better than all mass models that were tested."

The GDAs can be experimentally accessed through the study of amplitudes in $\\gamma^{\\ast} \\gamma \\to M_1 M_2$ and $\\gamma^{\\ast} \\to M_1 M_2 \\gamma$, where $M_1M_2$ is a pseudoscalar meson pair such as $\\pi \\eta $ and $\\eta \\eta^{\\prime}$. In this paper we calculate these amplitudes in the perturbative limit where the $M_1M_2$ GDAs are expressed in terms of meson distribution amplitudes which have been constrained in the past experiments. Our explicit calculation verifies the existence of a new EMT FF which breaks the conservation law of EMT for each quark flavor in its hadronic matrix element. In addition, our result shows that the $M_1M_2$ GDAs are identical between $\\gamma^{\\ast} \\gamma \\to M_1 M_2$ and $\\gamma^{\\ast} \\to M_1 M_2 \\gamma$, which confirms the universality of GDAs.

As such, excitation of the $^{229}$Th nuclear state has so far only been demonstrated in metal fluorides, specifically CaF$_2$, LiSrAlF$_6$, and ThF$_4$, where the large electronegativity of the halogen leads to sufficient band gaps. However, it is expected that the nuclear magnetic moment of the fluorine gives rise to a leading order broadening mechanism that limits the clock stability. Here, we use concepts of molecular design to identify a polyatomic anion, SO$_4^{2-}$, that is both nuclear spin free and of sufficient electron affinity to result in a high band gap metal sulfate system. Using state-of-the-art calculations, we find that the band gap of Th(SO$_4$)$_2$ is approximately 9 eV, large enough for direct laser excitation of $^{229}$Th. Low concentrations of $^{229}$Th in the otherwise spinless $^{232}$Th(SO$_4$)$_2$ crystal mitigate $^{229}$Th-$^{229}$Th interactions. Furthermore, the introduction of $^{229}$Th does not modify the material band gap nor introduce electronic states associated with nuclear quenching. By removing one of the primary sources of nuclear line broadening in the crystal, the nuclear magnetic dipole-dipole interaction, a nuclear clock with instability as low as $\\sigma = 4.6\\times10^{-23}/\\sqrt{\\tau}$, where ${\\tau}$ is the averaging time, may be realized.

The inclusion of the NNLO correction has an important impact on all observables considered in this work. Higher order corrections reduce scale uncertainty and in almost all cases are moderate. Overall, good perturbative convergence is observed across kinematics and observables. The uncertainty due to missing higher orders is relatively small and, in many cases, smaller than the experimental uncertainty. The largest source of theoretical uncertainty at present is from the knowledge of the non-perturbative parton-to-hadron fragmentation functions (FF), which dwarfs the scale uncertainty in most kinematic ranges. The inclusion of NNLO corrections demonstrates the precision studies potential of this class of observables. To fully realize this potential, however, a new generation of improved fragmentation functions may be needed. The results of the present work will enable global fits of FF with NNLO precision."

Eventually the cross-section becomes a random function and the scattering matrix elements follow a universal Gaussian distribution. For more than sixty years, this Ericson transition awaits a concise analytical treatment. We provide a complete solution within the Heidelberg approach which provides a full-fledged model of the scattering process.

Collective behaviors can be efficiently described in such systems through the implementation of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in mean-field approaches. However, as the thermodynamic limit does not make sense in finite-size systems, the latter can not exhibit any SSB and the symmetries which are broken down at the mean-field level must therefore be restored. The efficiency of theoretical approaches in the treatment of finite-size quantum systems can therefore be studied via their ability to restore spontaneously broken symmetries. In this thesis, a zero-dimensional $O(N)$ model is taken as a theoretical laboratory to perform such an investigation with many state-of-the-art path-integral techniques: perturbation theory combined with various resummation methods (Pad\\'e-Borel, Borel-hypergeometric, conformal mapping), enhanced versions of perturbation theory (transseries derived via Lefschetz thimbles, optimized perturbation theory), self-consistent perturbation theory based on effective actions (auxiliary field loop expansion (LOAF), Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) formalism, 4PPI effective action, ...), functional renormalization group (FRG) techniques (FRG based on the Wetterich equation, DFT-FRG, 2PI-FRG). Connections between these different techniques are also emphasized. In addition, the path-integral formalism provides us with the possibility to introduce collective degrees of freedom in an exact fashion via Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations: the effect of such transformations on the aforementioned methods is also examined in detail."

These interactions may affect a wide range of research areas from the MeV to GeV energy range, such as the reactor and geo neutrinos, diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB), dark matter, and nucleon decay searches. In this work, we extend our preceding paper, by conducting a first-time systematic exploration of NC backgrounds as low as the MeV region of reactor and geo neutrinos. We utilize up-to-date neutrino generator models from GENIE and NuWro, a TALYS-based nuclear deexcitation package and a GEANT4-based detector simulation toolkit for our complete calculation. Our primary focus is to predict the NC background for experimental searches of inverse-beta-decay signals below the 100 MeV visible energy. In order to have deeper understanding of the characteristics of atmospheric neutrino NC interactions in LS, we investigate the model dependence of NC background predictions by using various data-driven models, including the initial neutrino-nucleon interactions, nuclear ground-state structure, final-state interactions, nuclear deexcitation processes, and secondary interactions of final-state particles."

To this end, we present BNS_NURATES, a novel open-source numerical library designed for the efficient on-the-fly computation of neutrino interactions, with particular focus on regimes relevant to BNS mergers. BNS_NURATES targets a higher level of accuracy and realism in the implementation of commonly employed reactions by accounting for relevant microphysics effects on the interactions, such as weak magnetism and mean field effects. It also includes the contributions of inelastic neutrino scattering off electrons and positrons and (inverse) nucleon decays. Finally, it offers a way to reconstruct the neutrino distribution function in the framework of moment-based transport schemes. As a first application, we compute both energy-dependent and energy-integrated neutrino emissivities and opacities for conditions extracted from a BNS merger simulation with M1 transport scheme. We find some qualitative differences in the results when considering the impact of the additional relevant reactions and of microphysics effects. For example, neutrino-electron/positron scattering reactions are important for the energy exchange of heavy-type neutrinos as they do not undergo semileptonic charged-current processes, when $\\mu^\\pm$ are not accounted for. Moreover, weak magnetism and mean field effects can significantly modify the contribution of $\\beta$ processes for electron-type (anti)neutrinos, increasing at the same time the importance of (inverse) neutron decays. The improved treatment for the reaction rates also modifies the conditions at which neutrinos decouple from matter in the system, potentially affecting their emission spectra."

To extend the shell model's applicability across the nuclear chart, and specifically toward the driplines, we must first be able to efficiently test new interaction matrix elements and assign credible uncertainties.\n  Purpose: We develop and test a framework to efficiently fit new shell model interactions and obtain credible uncertainties. We further demonstrate its use by validating the uncertainty estimates of the known \\textit{sd}-shell effective interactions.\n  Methods: We use eigenvector continuation to emulate solutions to the exact shell model. First, we use the emulator to replicate earlier results using a well-known linear-combination chi-squared minimization algorithm. Then, we employ a modern Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to test for nonlinearities in the observable posterior distributions, which previous sensitivity analyses precluded.\n  Results: The emulator reproduces the USDB interaction within a small margin of error, allowing for the quantification of the matrix element uncertainty. However, we find that to obtain credible predictive intervals the model defect of the shell model itself, rather than experimental or emulator uncertainty/error, must be taken into account.\n  Conclusions: Eigenvector continuation can be used to accelerate fitting shell model interactions. We confirm that the linear approximation used to develop interactions in the past is indeed sufficient. However, we find that typical assumptions about the likelihood function must be modified in order to obtain a credible uncertainty-quantified interaction."

The two-stage abrasion-ablation model is used, with the abrasion stage described via the Glauber model, incorporating validated single-nucleon density distributions from proton elastic scattering data. In the ablation stage, where particle evaporation occurs, the contribution to charge-changing cross sections is estimated using two approaches. First, a statistical decay model is employed to analyze the evaporation of protons following neutron removal in the abrasion stage. The second approach estimates evaporation contributions by subtracting the direct process component (abrasion) from the experimental charge-changing cross section data. A comparison between these estimated contributions from the experimental data and the predictions of the statistical model enables a systematic evaluation of the evaporation process. The key factors influencing evaporation, such as excitation energy distribution parameters, decay width of the emitted particles, and nucleon separation energies, are analyzed. A strong correlation is observed between the maximum excitation energy available for evaporation and the neutron separation energy of the projectiles across different targets, highlighting the role of evaporation dynamics in the charge-changing cross sections."

However, controlling nuclear properties such as spin and magnetic moment remains an unprecedented challenge. Here, we put forward a novel method for nuclear excitation and control induced by intense vortex lasers. We develop a theory incorporating the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of vortex laser within the nuclear hyperfine mixing framework. We find that intense vortex laser can effectively excite hydrogen-like thorium-229 nucleus and induce three-dimensional rotation of the nuclear magnetic moment. This rotation arises from the localized electromagnetic field and new transition channels excited by the vortex laser, and can be reconstructed through radiation spectrum analysis. Moreover, the OAM of vortex laser enables the chaotic system to exhibit topologically protected periodic patterns in nuclear excitation and radiation, facilitating precise experimental measurements. Our findings underscore the potential of vortex laser for high-precision nuclear control and imaging, deepening our understanding of nuclear properties and hyperfine structure, and advancing quantum information and nuclear technologies."

The difference between them stems from the treatment of the phonon excitation modes; those not adopted as boson excitation modes in the former mapping are adopted in the latter mapping. When the commutation relations among the phonon operators are closed among the excitation modes adopted as the boson excitation modes in the mapping after truncation, the mapping after and the mapping before truncation coincide, not depending on the types, Hermitian and non-Hermitian. We also investigate the Park operator, which judges whether a boson state vector is physical, and reveal that the conventional claim, which claims that it is applicable only when the mapping is that of the whole fermion space, is incorrect."

Using the standard freeze-out picture within the relativistic hydrodynamic model, we explore how the possible pattern of the spin alignment can be generated using these microscopically calculated spectral functions.

Here, we explore the possibility of identifying experimental signatures of the QCD formation time, $\\tau_f$, on the level of a single parton splitting. Since heavy flavour offers an additional handle on tracing the propagation of individual quarks through the medium, we focus on the $g\\to c\\bar{c}$ splitting. Combining adapted versions of the Cambridge-Aachen and FlavourCone jet finding algorithms with grooming techniques, we show how the kinematics of such splittings can be reconstructed with high fidelity using either final state partons or hadrons, and how the formation time distribution of parton splittings can be constructed therefrom. Medium modification leads to a characteristic modification of this $\\tau_f$ distribution. This effect can be used to construct experimentally-accessible ratios of $\\tau_f$ distributions, in which the sensitivity of the medium modification to the QCD formation time becomes measurable."

The determination is accurate to next-to-next-to-leading order in the strong coupling, and includes heavy quark mass corrections in the analysis of DIS data. Uncertainties due to missing higher-order corrections are systematically incorporated by means of a covariance matrix determined by scale variations. NNPDFpol2.0 is based on a machine learning methodology, that makes use of Monte Carlo sampling for the representation of uncertainties into PDFs, of a neural network for the parametrisation of PDFs, of stochastic gradient descent for the optimisation of PDF parameters, and of hyperoptimisation for the selection of the best fitting model. We study the impact on PDFs of higher-order corrections, of the positivity constraint, and of the data. We demonstrate two phenomenological applications of NNPDFpol2.0, specifically the determination of the proton spin fraction carried by gluons and quarks, and of theoretical predictions for single-hadron production in longitudinally polarised DIS and proton-proton collisions."

In this paper we present a comprehensive discussion of its science objectives, providing state-of-the-art predictions for the capabilities of ET in both geometries currently under consideration, a single-site triangular configuration or two L-shaped detectors. We discuss the impact that ET will have on domains as broad and diverse as fundamental physics, cosmology, early Universe, astrophysics of compact objects, physics of matter in extreme conditions, and dynamics of stellar collapse. We discuss how the study of extreme astrophysical events will be enhanced by multi-messenger observations. We highlight the ET synergies with ground-based and space-borne GW observatories, including multi-band investigations of the same sources, improved parameter estimation, and complementary information on astrophysical or cosmological mechanisms obtained combining observations from different frequency bands. We present advancements in waveform modeling dedicated to third-generation observatories, along with open tools developed within the ET Collaboration for assessing the scientific potentials of different detector configurations. We finally discuss the data analysis challenges posed by third-generation observatories, which will enable access to large populations of sources and provide unprecedented precision."

Using the relativistic mean-field approximation with the QHD-ALP-DM framework, we compute the equation of state (EoS) of neutron stars. Based on our previous study, we find that typical ALP parameter values have no significant effect on the EoS. We then explore various parametrizations of this model by varying the DM Fermi momentum, $q_f$, and DM mass, $m_{\\chi}$. Our results show that increasing $q_f$ or $m_{\\chi}$ shifts the energy density to higher values while reducing the maximum mass, radius, and tidal deformability of neutron stars. Finally, comparison with observational constraints from gravitational wave events and pulsar measurements indicates that the allowed parameter space for this model is constrained to $q_f < 0.05$ MeV and $m_{\\chi} < 1000$ GeV.

However, the masses of the systems are degenerate with orbital inclination angle when using solely gravitational waves (GWs) or electromagnetic measurements, especially for face-on binaries. Taking advantages of both GWs and optical observations for LISA neutron-star white-dwarf (NS-WD) binaries, we propose a mass determination method utilising multi-messenger observational information. By combining the binary mass function obtained from optical observations and a GW mass function, that we introduce, derived from GW observations, we demonstrate how we can set improved constraints on the NS mass and break the degeneracy in the mass and viewing inclination determination. We further comment on the universal relation of the error bar of the GW mass function versus GW signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and propose a simple method for the estimate of capability of GW observations on mass determination with {LISA}. We show that for ultra-compact NS-WD binaries within our Galaxy, the mass of the NS can be constrained to within an accuracy of +- 0.2 \\solarmass with the proposed method."

When these eight scalar functions are expanded in terms of velocities order by order, we can return to the non-relativistic effective potential systematically organized by velocities. By retaining the exact momentum dependence in the effective potential, we estimate its corrections to the energy spectrum of hydrogen using a highly precise numerical method. The comparison of the numerical results with those obtained using conventional bound-state perturbative theory is discussed. Our calculations suggest that it is possible to accurately account for all relativistic contributions using this method.

To such end, we consider the uncertainty due to the experimental error of the femtoscopic $\\Lambda p$ data used to fix the chiral hyperon-nucleon interaction and the theoretical uncertainty, estimated from the residual cut-off dependence of this interaction. We find that the final maximum mass of a neutron star with hyperons is in the range $1.3-1.4$ $M_\\odot$, in agreement with previous works. The hyperon puzzle, therefore, remains still an open issue if only two-body hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions are considered.

In the framework of thermal model, a strong evidence of strangeness imbalance is observed in the experiments at lower collision energies relative to non-strange particles, particularly pions. The study indicates that like mass particle ratios in the system at the chemical freeze-out in URHIC can be described effectively by considering baryons (antibaryons) as point like as well as finite size particles which imitates hard-core repulsive interactions leading to an excluded volume type effect. In this analysis, we employ the statistical hadron resonance gas model for both cases. A comparison between the two cases is provided. However, the importance of considering baryons (antibaryons) as finite size particles is revealed in the description of baryon to meson ratios. Best fits to particle ratios are obtained using χ2-minimization procedure. For the case of finite-size baryons (antibaryons), we find that considering their hard-core radii allows us to fit the available antibaryon-to-baryon and baryon (antibaryon)-to-pion ratio experimental data simultaneously quite well with the same model parameter values. Moreover, our results align well with the proton radius puzzle observed in the muonic hydrogen measurement data. Furthermore, the study reveals two distinct chemical freeze-out stages in both cases, where the earlier one corresponds to baryonic (hyperonic) and antibaryonic (antihyperonic) states and a later one to mesonic degrees of freedom. A comparison of freeze-out lines obtained from both the cases is made along with the results of some earlier studies."

Neglecting results in an overestimated relative neutron density fluctuation extraction. In contrast, including enhances the agreement with experimental results with higher yield ratios but does not change the energy dependence of the yield ratio. Since the AMPT model does exhibit a first-order phase transition or critical physics, the study fails to reproduce the experimental energy-dependent peak around 20 − 30 GeV. The study'us findings might offer a baseline for investigating critical physics phenomena using light nuclei production as a probe."

Deflections of both null and timelike rays, with the finite distance effect of the source and detector considered, are obtained as dual series of and . These deflections enable a set of exact gravitational lensing equations from which the apparent angular positions of the images are solved. The method and general results are then applied to the Kerr-Newmann, Kerr-Sen, and rotating Simpson-Visser spacetimes to study the effect of the spin and characteristic (effective) charge of the spacetimes and the source altitude on the deflection angles and image apparent angles. We find that, generally, both the spacetime spin and charge affect only the deflections from the second non-trivial order, whereas the source altitude influences the deflection from the leading order. Because of this, measuring the effects of the spacetime spin and charge from the apparent locations of the images in gravitational lensing in realistic scenarios is difficult. We also present the off-equatorial deflections in the rotating Bardeen, Hayward, Ghosh, and Tinchev black hole spacetimes."

The polytropic index is calculated at finite temperature, revealing a negative correlation with the maximum mass of a PNS that the EOS can support. The properties of PNSs during the heating and cooling stages along their evolutionary path are explored under different combinations of lepton fraction and entropy. We investigate the correlation between symmetry energy slope L and the properties of PNSs. As L increases, the radius of a PNS also increases; however, this effect diminishes with a growing lepton fraction in the isentropic case. These results indicate that nuclear symmetry energy and its density dependence play crucial roles in determining the properties of PNSs and their evolutionary stages."

The measurements of Higgs boson branching fractions into and , where the W or Z bosons decay hadronically, are presented in the context of the CEPC experiment, assuming a scenario with 5600 fb−1 of collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 240 GeV. In this study the Higgs bosons are produced in association with a Z boson, with the Z boson decaying into a pair of muons , which have high efficiency and resolution. To separate all decay channels simultaneously with high accuracy, the Particle Flow Network (PFN), a graph-based machine learning model, is considered. The precise classification provided by the PFN is employed in measuring the branching fractions using the migration matrix method, which accurately corrects for detector effects in each decay channel. The statistical uncertainty of the measured branching ratio is estimated to be 0.55% in the final state and approximately 1.5% − 16% in the final states.

In particular, the FRDM underestimates the experimental α decay energies of superheavy nuclei. The α decay energies of known nuclei obtained using the FRDM are optimized using a neural network approach, i.e., FRDM-NN, and the accuracy improves significantly. The α decay energy systematics obtained using both the FRDM and FRDM-NN exhibit an evident shell effect at neutron number , implying that may be the magic number of the superheavy nucleus region. The α decay half-lives of known superheavy nuclei are calculated using the Generalized Liquid Drop Model (GLDM) and Royer formula with the input of the optimized α decay energies obtained using the FRDM-NN, and the calculations can reproduce the experimental data well. The α decay half-lives of unknown superheavy nuclei, in particular, superheavy nuclei with and 120, are also predicted using the GLDM and Royer formula with the input of the α decay energy obtained using the FRDM-NN. The relative error of two types of predicted α decay half-lives and superposition are analyzed, and the average predictions are given.

In this study, we consider Schwarzschild BHs embedded in a Dehnen-type DM halo with a quintessential field. This study examines the horizons, shadows, deflection angle, and quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the effective BH spacetime and how they are affected by the dark sector. The Schwarzschild BH embodied in a Dehnen-type DM halo with a quintessential field possesses two horizons: the event and cosmological horizons. We demonstrate that all dark sector parameters increase the event horizon while decreasing the cosmological horizon. We analyze the BH shadow and emphasize the impact of DM and quintessence parameters on the shadow. We show that the dark sector casts larger shadows than a Schwarzschild BH in a vacuum. Further, we delve into the weak gravitational lensing deflection angle using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (GBT). We then investigate the system's QNMs using the 6th order WKB approach. To visually demonstrate the dark sector parameters, we present figures that illustrate the impact of varying the parameters of the Dehnen-type DM halo as well as the quintessence background. Our findings show that the gravitational waves emitted by BHs with a dark sector have a lower frequency and decay rate compared to those emitted by BHs in a vacuum."

Additionally, the bending angle of light rays diminishes as the effective charge increases. Our study provides observational bounds on the effective charge based on these optical characteristics. We also examine the magnification of source brightness using the lens equation and analyze the time delay of light in the presence of a surrounding plasma medium.

Computations are performed for a total of 35 fp-shell nuclei using the proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA) model. The nuclei were selected because of their importance in various astrophysical environments. Pairing gaps are one of the key parameters in the pn-QRPA model to compute GT transitions. We employed three different values of the pairing gaps obtained from three different empirical formulae in our calculation. The GT strength distributions changed significantly as the pairing gap values changed. This in turn resulted in contrasting centroid and total strength values of the calculated GT distributions and led to differences in calculated half-lives using the three schemes. The half-life values computed via the three-term pairing formula, based on separation energies of nucleons, were in best agreement with the measured data.

Using the Korea-IBS-Daegu-SKKU density functional theory, we can create models that have an identical nuclear matter equation of state but different isoscalar and isovector effective masses at zero temperature. Effect of the effective mass becomes transparent at non-zero temperatures, and it becomes more important as temperature increases. Role of the effective mass is examined thoroughly by calculating the dependence of thermodynamic variables such as free energy, internal energy, entropy, pressure and chemical potential on density, temperature and proton fraction. We find that sensitivity to the isoscalar effective mass is several times larger than that of the isovector effective mass, so the uncertainties arising from the effective mass are dominated by the isoscalar effective mass. In the analysis of the relative uncertainty, we obtain that the maximum uncertainty is less than 2% for free energy, internal energy and chemical potential, but it amounts to 20% for pressure. Entropy shows a behavior completely different from the other four variables that the uncertainty is about 40% at the saturation density and increases monotonically as density increases. Effect of the uncertainty to properties of physical systems is investigated with the proto-neutron star. It is shown that temperature depends strongly on the effective mass at a given density and substantial swelling of the radius occurs due to the finite temperature. Equation of state is stiffer with smaller isoscalar effective mass, so the effect of the effective mass appears clearly in the mass-radius relation of the proto-neutron star, larger radius corresponding to smaller effective mass."

We find that rapidly cooling neutron stars driven by neutron superfluidity and direct Urca processes demonstrate delayed thermal relaxation under specific physical conditions. The former acquires that the neutron $^3P_2$ critical temperature is small enough, whereas the latter depends on the presence of a small core that permits direct Urca processes. To explore these scenarios, we propose simple theoretical frameworks to describe these delayed thermal relaxation behaviors and discuss how an recently-established enhanced modified Urca rate influences the relaxation time.

In this paper we present a systematic theoretical study of multi-point energy correlators for jets fragmenting in a dense quark-gluon plasma, accounting for both the medium's perturbative modification to the jet, and its hydrodynamical back-reaction. We consider both the scaling behavior of projected correlators, as well as the shape dependent three-point correlator, highlighting how both provide insight into interactions with the QGP.

We further attempt to filter out stars with a high chance of detectability by mass-radius measurement, i.e., stars with identical mass but different radii, so-called twin stars. However, we find that such configurations are outside the constrained parameter spaces. Instead, most of the mass-radius relations that feature a phase transition appear to be indistinguishable from a purely hadronic description."

It is shown that one of the Nambu-Goldstone modes appears as a result of meson-mixing. As is well known, another method to find the Nambu-Goldstone modes is given by the use of the algebraic commutation relations between broken generators and massless modes obtained through the spontaneous symmetry breaking. This method is adopted to the cases of the chiral symmetry breakings due to the tensor-type condensate and the inhomogeneous chiral condensate. The result obtained by the use of the meson two-point vertex functions is obviously reproduced in the case of the tensor-type condensate. Furthermore, we investigate the general rules for determining the broken symmetries and the Nambu-Goldstone modes algebraically. As examples, the symmetry breaking pattern and the Nambu-Goldstone modes due to the tensor-type condensate or the inhomogeneous chiral condensate are shown by adopting the general rules developed in this paper in the algebraic method."

While results from both methods have recently shown remarkable agreement for many observables, e.g., in Quantum Chromodynamics, an analysis of deviations in certain quantities turns out to be challenging. This is because calculations with the two methods are based on different approximations, regularizations and scale fixing procedures. In the present work, we present a framework for a more direct comparison by formulating the functional RG approach on a finite spacetime lattice. This removes all ambiguities of regularization, finite size and scale fixing procedures in concrete studies. By investigating the emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking and phase transitions in a $Z(2)$ scalar theory in $d=1,2,3$ spacetime dimensions, we demonstrate at the example of the local potential approximation how this framework can be used to evaluate and compare the systematic errors of both approaches."

Since the AMPT model does not include magnetic field effects, we expect comparing its output between Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collision systems can provide an insight of the possible bias of flow background definition, and help improve the measurement of CME signal in real experiments. Multiple combinations of centrality and flow definition were chosen to study how the $v_2$ and their difference would be affected, especially by varying the particles selection of charge versus neutral properties and broadening (pseudo-)rapidity regions, while STAR CME work relied on charged-only particles at central rapidity."

In this regard, extending existing knowledge to an emerging field of physics -- where particles interact with a relatively low-energy but high intensity field (intense enough so that multi-particle processes become comparable or more important than one-to-one processes) -- can lead to exciting discoveries. Investigations can be realized under a highly time-compressed beam source (e.g., particle sources generated by laser-matter interaction using high-power laser systems). Here we focus on a new scheme, where high-power laser systems are exploited as a driver to generate energetic ($\\gamma$-ray) photons.

In the standard calculations of EC, the lepton wave functions are usually considered in the lowest-order approximation. In this work, we investigate the sensitivity of EC rates on the choice of the electron wave functions by (i) assuming the single-particle approximation for the electron wave functions, and (ii) carrying out Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) calculations. The nuclear response is generated based on the state-of-the-art quasiparticle random phase approximation employing relativistic nuclear energy density functional theory. We show that using the improved lepton wave functions reduces the EC rates up to 40\\% in the superheavy nucleus oganesson ($Z=118$).

Lithium and beryllium are fragile elements that are highly sensitive to the physical conditions, as well as to transport and mixing processes within and below the convective zone (CZ). Uncovering the transport mechanisms responsible for the depletion of Li and Be in the Sun is crucial for using them as tools to understand stellar interiors and the associated transport and mixing processes. We constructed rotating solar models based on Magg's abundance scale, incorporating the effects of convective overshoot and magnetic fields. The rotating model exhibits superior sound speed and density profile and successfully reproduces the observed ratios $r_{02}$ and $r_{13}$. It also matches the seismically inferred CZ depth, surface helium abundance, and rotation profile, as well as the detected Li and Be abundances and neutrino fluxes within $1\\sigma$. The depletion of Li is dominated by convective overshoot and rotational mixing, while Be depletion is primarily driven by gravitational settling and rotational mixing. The presence of the tachocline accelerates Li depletion but slows down Be depletion. These distinct depletion mechanisms result in the surface abundances of Li and Be evolving differently over time."

Understanding such systems requires precise knowledge of hadron interactions, which traditional scattering experiments struggle to provide, especially in the low-energy region.

For this reason, as we argue, the two-body approach works well for kaon-deuteron correlations but it fails for proton-deuteron ones in case of small sources. Applying the three-body approach generalized to the case where the radius of the hadron source is different from the nucleon source radius, we derive the source radius formula which used in the two-body approach gives the correlation function as in the `factorized' three-body one.

Here, the maximal entanglement predicts a relation between the jet fragmentation function and the entropy of hadrons produced in jet fragmentation. We test this relation using the ATLAS Collaboration data on jet production at the Large Hadron Collider and find good agreement between the prediction based on maximal entanglement within the jet and the data.

In contrast, the restoration of particle number symmetry yields modifications of only about 1%. With the isovector spin-spin terms of the functional previously adjusted in near doubly magic nuclei across the mass chart, the calculations were parameter-free. Effective charges and $g$-factors were not employed. A reasonably good agreement was achieved between the calculated and measured electric quadrupole moments.

In this work, we propose to measure the medium-induced modifications of the elliptic anisotropy inside jets in relativistic heavy-ion collisions to provide novel insight into the jet quenching phenomenon. By simulating the jet propagation in the hot and dense nuclear medium with a Linear Boltzmann Transport model, we observe a de-correlation in the two-particle azimuthal angular distribution for inclusive jet production in AA collisions relative to that in pp collisions, which results in significant suppression of the in-jet elliptic anisotropy coefficient $v_2$. This phenomenon arises from the stochastic and strong interactions with the thermal QGP medium undergone by the jet particles. Furthermore, the nuclear modifications of the in-jet $v_2$ are found to be sensitive to the medium properties in the model study, which provide a potential probe for the jet tomography of nuclear matter."

We employ covariant kernels {within the generalized CPS framework} to develop two approaches that naturally yield exact evaluation of time correlation functions (TCFs) for pure discrete (electronic) DOFs. In addition, we briefly discuss the phase space mapping formalisms where the contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression of the {TCF} of population dynamics is strictly positive semi-definite.

Considering the effect of rotations, lattice QCD data shows that the temperatures for deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration should increase with real angular velocity, and the dominant effects are related to gluonic degrees of freedom. These findings could be essential for quark models in rotating systems that lack gluonic interactions, which predicts the decreasing of the chiral temperature transition with the angular velocity. To address this issue properly, in this work we apply the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model to explore the phase diagram in a rotating rigid cylinder with constant angular velocity in the mean field approximation. To circumvent the absence of gluons, we propose the application of an effective coupling dependent of the angular velocity, fitted to match the pseudocritical temperature of chiral phase transition in the model through lattice QCD data. Our results indicate that the running coupling induces the enhancement of the chiral condensate as a function of angular velocity, strengthening the breaking of chiral symmetry, an effect previously dubbed as chiral vortical catalysis. For the chiral susceptibility we observe stronger fluctuations around the transition temperature when we consider the running coupling. The phase diagram is affected by these findings shifting the critical end point (CEP) to higher temperatures and chemical potentials."

We develop a customized approximation that fully accounts for the Landau-level quantization of electron states while neglecting such quantization for quarks. This approach is well-justified in dense quark matter, where the chemical potentials of up and down quarks significantly exceed those of electrons. Our analysis provides a detailed exploration of the influence of strong magnetic fields on neutrino emission, including both the modification of the total emission rate and the emergence of emission asymmetry relative to the magnetic field direction. We further examine the role of temperature in smoothing the oscillatory behavior of neutrino emission as a function of magnetic field strength. Additionally, we study the interplay between the Landau-level quantization of electrons and the Fermi-liquid effects of quarks in modifying the phase space of relevant weak processes. Finally, we briefly discuss the broader implications of magnetic fields on stellar cooling processes and the potential contribution of asymmetric neutrino emission to pulsar kicks."

They are now able to follow the entire evolution from core collapse through bounce, neutrino-triggered shock revival, shock breakout at the stellar surface to the electromagnetic SN outburst and the subsequent SN remnant phase. Thus they provide general support for the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism by reproducing observed SN energies, neutron-star (NS) kicks, and diagnostically relevant radioactive isotope yields; they allow to predict neutrino and gravitational-wave signals for many seconds of proto-NS cooling; they confirm correlations between explosion and progenitor or remnant properties already expected from previous spherically symmetric (1D) and 2D models; and they carve out various scenarios for stellar-mass black-hole (BH) formation. Despite these successes it is currently unclear which stars explode or form BHs, because different modeling approaches disagree and suggest the possible importance of the 3D nature of the progenitors and of magnetic fields. The role of neutrino flavor conversion in SN cores still needs to be better understood, the nuclear equation of state including potential phase transitions implies major uncertainties, the SN 1987A neutrino measurements raise new puzzles, and tracing a possible correlation of NS spins and kicks requires still more refined SN simulations."

In this Letter, we employ a class of relativistic energy density functionals in a twofold process: first, to link the electric dipole polarizability from recent experiments to the slope of the symmetry energy, and second, to translate this information into constraints on the tidal deformability and radii of neutron stars, in connection with multimessenger astrophysical observations from pulsars and binary neutron stars. We provide compelling evidence that the electric dipole polarizability represents a key nuclear observable to probe the neutron star properties. By significantly reducing the uncertainties in the mass-radius plane, our findings also align with recent multimessenger observations."

Using best-fit parameters from neutrino oscillation experiments, the minimum neutrino mass is determined from the sum of the three neutrino mass eigenstates, $\\Sigma = m_1 + m_2 + m_3,$ which is represented by two narrow bands centered at approximately 0.06 eV/c$^2$ for the normal hierarchy (NH) and 0.102 eV/c$^2$ for the inverted hierarchy (IH). Under these constraints, the minimum neutrino mass is found to be 0.001186 eV/c$^2$ for NH and 0.002646 eV/c$^2$ for IH, thereby establishing a potential absolute neutrino mass scale for both scenarios. From these values, we calculate $|m_{\\beta\\beta}|$, which plays a central role in $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay. By combining $|m_{\\beta\\beta}|$ with decay phase-space factors, nuclear matrix elements, and the absorption probability of the virtual Majorana neutrino, we estimate the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ half-life for key isotopes, namely, $^{76}$Ge, $^{130}$Te, and $^{136}$Xe, using two independent methods. The results are in good agreement, and we also discuss the uncertainties in the nuclear matrix elements that may affect these calculations."

Our formalism is based on the Schwinger-Dyson equation, employing a specific symmetry-preserving vector-vector flavor-dressed contact interaction model of quarks in Landau gauge, utilizing the rainbow-Ladder truncation. We derive expressions for the dressed quark mass $M_f$ and effective potential $\\Omega^{f}$ at zero, at finite temperature $T$ and the quark chemical potential $\\mu$. The transition between chiral symmetry breaking and restoration is triggered by the effective potential of the contact interaction, whereas the confinement and deconfinement transition is approximated from the confinement length scale $\\tilde{\\tau}_{ir}$. Our analysis reveals that at $(T = \\mu = 0)$, increasing $N_f$ leads to the restoration of chiral symmetry and the deconfinement of quarks when $N_f$ reaches its critical value, $N^{c}_{f} \\approx 8$. At this critical value, In the chiral limit ($m_f = 0$), the global minimum of the effective potential occurs at the point where the dressed quark mass approaches zero ($M_f \\rightarrow 0$). However, when a bare quark mass of $m_f = 7$ MeV is introduced, the global minimum shifts slightly to a nonzero value, approaching $M_f \\rightarrow m_f$. At finite $T$ and $\\mu$, we illustrate the QCD phase diagram in the $(T^{\\chi,C}_{c} -\\mu)$ plane, for various numbers of light quark flavors, noting that both the critical temperature $T_c$ and the critical chemical potential $\\mu_c $ for chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement decrease as $ N_f $ increases. Moreover, the critical endpoint $(T_{EP}, \\mu_{EP})$ also shifts to lower values with increasing $N_f $. Our findings are consistent with other low-energy QCD approaches."

These distributions are usually fitted with Gaussian functions.\n  Purpose: To investigate how the properties of these ``Gaussian fission modes'' compare with underlying ``theoretical fission modes'' defined from the potential energy surface of the fissioning nuclei.\n  Methods: A simple approach, inspired by the scission point model, is introduced to investigate the impact of anharmonicity of the potential along the scission line on Gaussian mode properties. This approach is also used to evaluated an ``effective potential'' from the yields.\n  Results: Several Gaussian functions are usually required to fit yields from non-harmonic potentials associated with a unique theoretical mode. Similarly, ``effective fission modes'', defined from the wells of the effective potentials, are sometime very different to the Gaussian modes. For instance, the S1 and S2 Brosa modes contribute to the same effective potential well at scission.\n  Conclusions: Gaussian fits are useful to identify the role of shell effects in fission. However, comparisons with theoretical potential energy surfaces are better carried with effective potentials extracted from the yields, assuming that a broad range of excitation energies is available."

We employ two equations of state (EoSs) for matter consistent with inference from the observational data. In the crossover scenario the EoS is softened in a density realized in binary-neutron-star mergers and is smoothly continued to quark matter. In the phase transition scenario without crossover, the EoS remains stiff and a first-order phase transition takes place in a density out of reach of mergers. A GW170817-like system forms a remnant massive neutron star in both scenarios, and it collapses into a black hole only in the crossover scenario due to the softening while gravitational-wave emission is strong. This difference is clearly reflected in the sudden shutdown of gravitational waves. For a given EoS, the lifetime of the merger remnant is determined primarily by the total mass of the system. Identifying these features in a variety of future events with the next generation of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors will enable us to clarify details of hadron-quark transition. The mass of the accretion disk surrounding the remnant black hole is affected not only by the lifetime of the remnant but also by the mass ratio of the system. Electromagnetic emission associated with the disk outflow will also be useful for detailed investigation of the hadron-quark transition."

Such terms arise because the presence of the acceleration vector in the system allows Curie's theorem, which governs symmetry constraints, to be extended for constructing invariants from tensors of different ranks evaluated at distinct space-time points. The new terms are identified in the context of a complete set of second-order equations governing the shear-stress tensor, bulk-viscous pressure, and charge-diffusion currents for a generic quantum system characterized by the energy-momentum tensor and multiple conserved charges.

Understanding how nuclear interactions shape the dUrca threshold is essential for interpreting neutron star thermal evolution, particularly in light of recent studies on exceptionally cold objects. We investigate the impact of incorporating the scalar isovector $\\delta$ meson into the neutron star equation of state, which alters the internal proton fraction and consequently affects the dUrca cooling threshold. Since proton superfluidity is known to suppress dUrca rates, we also examine the interplay between the nuclear interaction mediated by the $\\delta$ meson and the $^1S_0$ proton pairing gap. We perform a Bayesian analysis using models built within a relativistic mean-field approximation, incorporating constraints from astrophysical observations, nuclear experiments, and known results of \\textit{ab initio} calculations of pure neutron matter. We then impose a constraint on the dUrca threshold based on studies of fast-cooling neutron stars. The inclusion of $\\delta$ meson expands the range of possible internal compositions, directly influencing the stellar mass required for the central density to reach the dUrca threshold. Furthermore, we observe that the observation of relatively young and cold neutron stars provides insights into $^1S_0$ proton superfluidity in the core of neutron stars."

In the absence of sufficient dissipation, this instability emerges within the hydrodynamic regime, depending on the interplay between shear viscosity and the anomalous vortical contribution to the stress-energy tensor at second order in hydrodynamic expansion. We show that this instability generates helical flows and name it the {\\it chiral vortical instability} (CVI). Alongside the chiral plasma and magnetovortical instabilities, CVI tends to transfer initial microscopic chirality into macroscopic helicities, which combine into a generalized axial charge. We further find that an elementary static Gromeka-Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, corresponding to a CSW at a specific momentum, solves the full nonlinear equations of second-order chiral hydrodynamics, whereas global rotation of a chiral medium is not a solution. This observation supports the relevance of CVI beyond the hydrodynamic regime. Finally, we briefly note that CVI may have multiple phenomenological implications across various systems, including QCD matter produced in heavy-ion collisions and primordial plasma in the early Universe."

Next, we analyze the nature of the corrections due to the finite range of the strong interaction, closely linked to off-shell effects, and propose an approximate method to account for them. We show how these corrections turn out to be essential to accurately extract the strong hadron-hadron scattering amplitudes from CF data. We compare the obtained expressions for the CFs with those reported in previous theoretical frameworks. Also, using proton-proton systems as a case study, we obtain a good comparison of our results with previous realistic theoretical calculations and with accurate recent data from the ALICE experiment.

Particles oriented in the direction in which the QCD medium formed in these collisions is shorter, suffer less energy loss, and thus, are over-represented in the final ensemble compared to those oriented in the direction in which the medium is longer. In this work we present the first semi-analytical predictions, including propagation through a realistic, hydrodynamical background, of the azimuthal anisotropies for jets, obtaining a quantitative agreement with available experimental data as function of the jet $p_T$, its cone size $R$ and the collisions centrality. Jets are multi-partonic, extended objects and their energy loss is sensitive to substructure fluctuations. This is determined by the physics of color coherence that relates to the ability of the medium to resolve those partonic fluctuations. Namely, color dipoles whose angle is smaller than a critical angle, $\\theta_c$, are not resolved by the medium and they effectively act as a coherent source of energy loss. We find that jet azimuthal anisotropies have a specially strong dependence on coherence physics due to the marked length-dependence of $\\theta_c$. By combining our predictions for the collision systems and center of mass energies studied at RHIC and the LHC, covering a wide range of typical values of $\\theta_c$, we show that the relative size of jet azimuthal anisotropies for jets with different cone-sizes $R$ follow a universal trend that indicates a transition from a coherent regime of jet quenching to a decoherent regime. These results suggest a way forward to reveal the role played by the physics of jet color decoherence in probing deconfined QCD matter."

A blast-wave model and a blast-wave-based particle generator, coupled to a hadronic transport model, are utilized. Bayesian inference methods are applied to extract the most probable sets of thermodynamic parameters at the chemical freeze-out hypersurface. Both models for the overpopulated pion states, the hadronic transport model and the thermal model with a nonzero pion chemical potential, provide a satisfactory description of the observed pion spectra. However, both approaches contain approximations which can be improved within a systematic nonequilibrium approach.

We first calculate the effective potential for axions at finite baryon density and zero temperature including the effects of a first order chiral phase transition. Using the equation of state for quark matter with axions and a hadronic matter equation of state in the ambit of a relativistic mean field theory in quantum hadrodynamics, we discuss the hadron-quark phase transition. Inclusion of axions reduces the critical density for chiral transition. We use a Gibbs construct for the hadron-quark phase transition satisfying the constraints of beta equilibrium and charge neutrality as appropriate for the neutron star matter. The equation of state so obtained is used to investigate the structure of hybrid neutron stars. It is found that with the presence of axions, it is possible to have stable hybrid neutron stars having an inner core of quark matter both in pure quark matter phase as well as in a mixed phase with hyperonic matter along with a outer core of hyperonic matter and is in agreement with modern astrophysical constraints. We also discuss the properties of non-radial oscillations of such hybrid neutron stars.

Recent proposals suggest that one-flavor baryons can instead be interpreted as quantum Hall droplets on the $\\eta'$ domain wall, providing a potential link to quark--hadron continuity at high density. In retrospect, the qualitative or semi-qualitative construction of one-flavor baryons on the $\\eta'$ domain wall reveals that these baryons can be described as quantum Hall droplets, resembling topological solitons akin to skyrmions. Using an effective theory on the $\\eta'$ domain wall, which is conjectured to be the Chern--Simons--Higgs theory, it is discussed that its vortex solution with unit baryon numbers naturally has a spin of $N_c/2$, and thus can be interpreted as a baryon or multi-baryon structure. The particle--vortex duality suggests that quarks carry a fractional topological charge of $1/N_c$ and obey fractional statistics. In terms of chiral bag models, confinement can be attributed to the monopoles confined within the bag, and the vector meson fields on the bag surface are essential for ensuring the correct baryon number in the chiral bag framework, thereby providing deeper insights into baryons as non-trivial topological structures of the meson field. In this paper, we review the progress in this development, with a special focus on the $\\eta^\\prime$ domain wall dynamics. Naive extensions to $N_f \\geq 2$ are also discussed."

This novel parameter is fitted by using the quark condensate from lattice QCD at finite temperature. Our approach provides a significant enhancement to the chiral phase diagram, accurately reproducing the pseudocritical temperature at μB = 0 and aligning the crossover boundary with lattice QCD results. The quark condensate is used to ascertain the location of the phase transition, and we find an area where both phases coexist. The chiral susceptibility is employed to identify the pseudo-critical line in the crossover region. The skewness ratios and the kurtosis ratios varying with T at several different μB are calculated meticulously, and the results demonstrate that they experience a significant change around the pseudo-critical line. Additionally, the skewness ratios and the kurtosis ratios along the pseudo-critical line (Tc(μB)) and the lines deviating from Tc(μB) are computed to gain a better understanding of the experimental results.

As such, understanding these mechanisms and how they relate to one another is key to understanding the intricate dynamics that drive the formation (or dissociation) of the nascent compound nuclei formed in fusion reactions. This understanding directly translates to a more informed picture of suitable reaction partners and can provide vital information for experimental efforts to study the physics and chemistry of superheavy elements. In this work we report results from time-dependent simulations of $^{48}$Ca + $^{238}$U and $^{50}$Ti + $^{236}$Th reactions at incident energies just above the Coulomb barrier with a focus on the quasifission process that prevent the formation of a fully equilibrated $^{286}$Cn compound nucleus. We study these reactions systematically and consider a wide range of initial configurations to extract a robust estimate of primary fragment yields for the quasifission process. Multiple preferred exit channels are observed, with both spherical and deformed shell effects in the heavy and light fragments driving contributions to the production yields depending on the initial configuration of the system. Orientation effects of the deformed actinide targets are found to be a primary driver of which exit channels are populated. Furthermore, the impact of moving away from a doubly-magic projectile is explored with implications towards the reactions considered for current and future superheavy searches."

The observational limits from NICER, GW170817, etc., are obeyed by our choice of equations of state. The universal relations are investigated for both slowly and rapidly rotating neutron stars with heavy baryons present inside the core. For slowly rotating stars, the universality of the I-Love-Q relations is verified, and the I-C-Q relations are inferred to be universal for rapidly rotating stars. Further, we extend the investigation to obtain the universal relations for compact stars containing the quark core, where the connected stable branch of such hybrid stars is considered. The parameters of the I-Love-Q and I-C-Q universal relations are obtained for slowly rotating and rapidly rotating hybrid stars, respectively. These relations would enable extracting information, within the context of general relativity, from astrophysical systems involving rapidly rotating neutron stars."

A total of 16 parameter sets within the RMF framework are assessed based on their ability to reproduce ground-state properties such as the mean squared radius and binding energy, as obtained in QMD simulations. Among these, the NS2 parameter set is identified as the most suitable for describing stable nuclei over a wide mass range, with the use of an adaptive Gaussian wave packet width. Fragmentation cross sections of carbon ion projectiles on light nuclei targets (H, C, O, Al, Ti, and Cu) are simulated at incident energies of 50, 95, 290, and 400 MeV/u and compared with experimental data. The results indicate that the RQMD.RMF model provides superior reproductions for fragmentation at lower energies (50 and 95 MeV/u) compared to the Light Ion QMD (LIQMD) model implemented in Geant4 version 11.2. At higher energies (290 and 400 MeV/u), the RQMD.RMF model performs comparably to the LIQMD. This study demonstrates that the RQMD.RMF model provides a reliable framework for analyzing nuclear fragmentation and holds potential for applications in the planning and quality assurance of hadron therapy."

In this talk, we discuss a first step in exploring such correlations by studying how a $q\\bar q$ state produced from an initial unpolarized gluon couples to the anisotropies of an underlying static QCD medium. The medium anisotropy is captured by allowing the jet quenching parameter to take different magnitudes in two orthogonal directions in the plane transverse to the jet axis. We find that the final particle distribution is sensitive to the medium anisotropy in the form of an azimuthal angle modulation, and more importantly, that this effect couples directly to the helicity/spin of the final states, offering a novel way to extract the details of the underlying matter which is not accessible with standard jet observables. We further show how such features can be extracted from the Fourier decomposition of the distribution and from final state transverse spin polarization measurements."

Utilizing a pionless effective field theory framework, we determine that the presence of Efimov states in the spectrum of the $D^*D^*D^*$ system is contingent upon the existence of an $(I,J)=(1,2)$ $D^*D^*$ two-body bound system. If only the $T_{cc}^+$ and its heavy quark spin partner $T_{cc}^{*+}$ exist while there is no near-threshold pole in all other $S$-wave $D^{(*)}D^*$ scattering amplitudes, no Efimov effect is expected in the $D^{(*)}D^*D^*$ systems."

This may raise concerns about the applicability of popular but too simple approaches for systems with light mesons.

Despite intensive search, no CP violations have been found in the strong interaction. This puzzle is referred to as the strong CP problem. There is evidence that CP is conserved in the confining theory, to the extent that color charges are totally screened for $\\theta > 0$ at large distances. It is not immediately obvious that this implies a vanishing dipole moment though. With this Letter I will close the gap. It is shown that in the infinite volume hadron correlation functions decouple from the topological charge, expressed in terms of the zero modes. The reason is that hadrons have a limited range of interaction, while the density of zero modes vanishes with the inverse root of the volume, thus reducing the probability of finding a zero mode in the vicinity to zero. This implies that CP is conserved in the strong interaction."

Understanding their internal structure is important for many areas of nuclear physics, such as nuclear forces, dense matter, and neutrino-nucleus interactions. Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) are an established tool for characterizing the QCD structure of the ground-state nucleon. They are used to create 3D tomographic images of the quark/gluon structure and quantify the mechanical properties such as the distribution of mass, angular momentum and forces in the system. Transition GPDs extend these concepts to $N \\rightarrow N^\\ast$ transitions and can be used to characterize the 3D structure and mechanical properties of baryon resonances. They can be probed in high-momentum-transfer exclusive electroproduction processes with resonance transitions $e + N \\rightarrow e' + M + N^\\ast$, such as deeply-virtual Compton scattering ($M = \\gamma$) or meson production ($M = \\pi, K$, $etc.$), and in related photon/hadron-induced processes. This White Paper describes a research program aiming to explore baryon resonance structure with transition GPDs. This includes the properties and interpretation of the transition GPDs, theoretical methods for structures and processes, first experimental results from JLab 12 GeV, future measurements with existing and planned facilities (JLab detector and energy upgrades, COMPASS/AMBER, EIC, EicC, J-PARC, LHC ultraperihperal collisions), and the theoretical and experimental developments needed to realize this program."

Within the model, feeble interaction between fermionic DM $\\chi$ and strange quark matter (SQM) is invoked via a vector new physics mediator $\\xi$ with coupling strength $y_{\\xi}$. The pure SQM is described by the vector MIT Bag model. By varying different EoS parameters, the structural properties viz. the mass, radius and tidal deformability ($\\Lambda$) of the DMSQSs are studied with respect to various astrophysical constraints. We study in detail the $f$-mode spectra within the Cowling approximation by obtaining the frequencies as a function of mass, compactness and $\\Lambda$ of the star. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first analysis of non-radial $f$-mode oscillations of DMSQSs. Our investigation indicates that the presence of DM and its interaction with SQM has great impact on the $f$-modes. We show that the $f$-mode frequencies are larger for DMSQSs, which are largely populated with massive DM fermions, compared to the SQSs. Further, we obtain a linear empirical relation between the $f$-modes and the average density of the star.

To bridge QCD physics with macroscopic dynamics, we further incorporate a temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility ($\\chi_{m}(T)$) derived from lattice QCD, capturing the transition from diamagnetic hadronic matter ($\\chi_{m}  0$). Our simulations reveal that $\\chi_{m}(T)$ introduces a feedback loop: delayed energy dissipation sustains higher temperatures, reinforcing paramagnetic behavior and altering field evolution. These results quantify the critical role of magnetic field dynamics in regulating QGP thermalization and highlight the necessity of QCD-informed susceptibilities for realistic RMHD modeling."

The interaction between quarks fully respects the chiral and flavor symmetries. Guided by the success of various low energy theorems, we assume that the explicit breaking of these symmetries occurs only via the current quark masses, and all other symmetry breakings are of dynamical nature. In order to take into account the effects of the finite quark core sizes of the baryons on the equation of state, we make use of an excluded volume framework which respects thermodynamic consistency. The effects generated by the swelling quark cores generally act repulsively and lead to an increase of the pressure with increasing baryon density. On the other hand, in neutron star matter they also lead to a decrease of the density window where hyperons appear, because it becomes energetically more favorable to convert the faster moving nucleons into hyperons. Our quantitative analysis shows that the net effect of the excluded volume is too small to solve the long standing \"hyperon puzzle,\" which is posed by the large observed masses of neutron stars. Thus the puzzle persists in a relativistic effective quark theory which takes into account the short range repulsion between baryons caused by their finite and swelling quark core sizes in a phenomenological way."

The $\\nu$-point projected energy correlators (or, $\\nu$-correlators) are an analytically continued family of the integer $N$-point projected energy correlators, which probe correlations between $N$ final-state particles. By tracking the largest separation ($\\chi$) between the $N$ particles, in vacuum, their structure is closely related to the DGLAP splitting functions and exhibits a classical scaling behavior $\\sim 1/\\chi$ which is modified by resummation through the anomalous dimensions. We show that, in a thermal medium, the $\\nu$-correlators display non-trivial angular scaling already at the leading order in perturbation theory. We find that for non-integer values, particularly $\\nu1$. This is particularly manifested in the ratios of $\\nu$-correlators with respect to the two-point energy correlator which encode an intrinsic angular information for $\\nu<1$ when compared to large $\\nu$ values.

Probing the T-odd NEC involves measuring a single transverse spin asymmetry (SSA) for the energy pattern in the target fragmentation region in deep inelastic scattering. We find that while the inclusive energy pattern results in a vanishing SSA, a nonzero SSA emerges when restricting the measurement to charged hadrons, which are directly measured in tracking detectors. To describe this effect, we introduce the track-based NEC and evaluate its small-$x$ limit from fracture functions using the energy sum rule. The resulting SSA exhibits an opposite sign between positively and negatively charged hadrons, providing a clear experimental signature of the odderon. Furthermore, by incorporating charge weighting into the NEC, we construct a C-odd tag in the final state, eliminating potential contamination from C-even gluonic contributions. Our results demonstrate that these track-based energy-pattern observables offer a clean and sensitive probe for unveiling odderon dynamics at the future electron-ion collider."

Distinguishing experimentally gauge inequivalent sources (and hence potentials) that produce the same field tensor is one major task in this endeavour. As a step in this direction, this paper investigates how physically distinct sources which produce the same color electric field (uniform and constant) may be distinguished experimentally in a gauge-invariant manner. We first study the motion of a test particle in such fields and show that the resultant trajectories are counterintuitive. We then examine the radiation emitted - both gluonic and photonic and show that each source (independent non-abelian configuration) leaves a unique signature in the energy spectra, laying the ground for application to specific physical systems."

The exact form of that theory is unknown, but at low energies chiral symmetry and its breaking are considered as the construction recipes for modeling the theory. The Skyrmion is a static, localized solution in a non-linear field theory for pions and it is the most prominent version of a soliton in a chirally symmetric meson theory. Upon quantization it reproduces the spectrum of the low-lying baryons and their static properties reasonably well. Extending that theory by vector mesons improves on the agreement between predicted and empirical data. Chiral solitons within models for the quark flavor dynamics facilitate the investigation of nucleon structure functions. Here we provide a pedagogical overview of these facets."

The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime."

We find that the parametric optical model uncertainty in neutron-fragment correlated observables involving neutron energy is significant.

In addition, we can fit neutrino data for cases that are disfavored in minimal models. Furthermore, some correlations among sum of neutrino mass and CP violating phases are still observed, although we have more free parameters."

Previous band structure calculations suggest that the entrainment effect significantly reduces the superfluid density. In this letter, a new derivation of the BCS expression for the superfluid density is given. We compute it in the superfluid band theory framework through linear response theory, for a small relative velocity between superfluid and normal components, under the assumption that the pairing gap in the rest frame of the superfluid is constant and not affected by the perturbation. Our result suggests that a formula extensively used in neutron star physics is incomplete. Numerical evaluations for two realistic configurations reveal that the previously neglected contribution drastically alters the picture of the superfluid reservoir in the inner crust of neutron stars, suggesting that about 90% of the neutrons are effectively superfluid."

In this paper, we present the FFs for $K_S^0$, $\\eta$, $\\pi^0$ mesons, and $\\Lambda$ baryons in the context of global QCD analysis. The data included in the fit are from single inclusive $e^+ e^-$ annihilation (SIA), semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) and proton-proton collisions, with kinematic cuts carefully applied to ensure validity of collinear factorization and perturbative QCD expansion. For the first time, data from SIDIS and hadron-in-jet production in SIA have been incorporated into the extraction of FFs for light-flavor neutral hadrons. Our analysis reveals that these data play a critical role in constraining the gluon distribution, and in distinguishing between different quark flavors. Pulls from different datasets are also studied by performing alternative fits with systematically subtracting groups of data from the nominal fit. For the quality of the fit, good $\\chi^2$ values are achieved for most of the datasets, and FFs are generally well constrained within the momentum fraction region $\\pqty{0.1, 0.5}$. The extracted $K_S^0$ fragmentation functions, together with the $K_S^0$ FFs constructed from $K^{\\pm}$ FFs via isospin symmetry, are used to test isospin symmetry in kaon fragmentation. Although a definitive conclusion cannot be reached yet, these studies have identified several potential measurements that can be performed at existing facilities, which may ultimately help us to arrive at a conclusive answer. With the comprehensive species of FFs extracted within the NPC framework, we are able to perform a test on the momentum sum rule with the light-flavor charged and neutral hadrons."

The effective field theory model is introduced to calculate the compositeness, the probability of finding the hadronic molecular component. Applying the new interpretation scheme for the complex compositeness of unstable states and using the bare energies of the compact component estimated by the constituent quark model, we find that approximately 50 % of the $T_{cc}$ wavefunction is occupied by the $D^{0}D^{*+}$ molecular component. This indicates that the structure of $T_{cc}$ is primarily dominated by the $D^0D^{*+}$ component, having the nearest threshold. However, other components, such as the isospin partner $D^{*0}D^{+}$ channels, also provide non-negligible contributions. On the other hand, about 90 % of $X(3872)$ is composed of the $D^{0}\\bar{D}^{0*}$ molecular component. This is because the non-composite bare state and the charged $D\\bar{D}^{*}$ threshold are located relatively far from the $X(3872)$ and contribute very little to its internal structure."

Based on the framework in which the short-range correlation and the quantum diffusion model are incorporated into the Glauber theory, the experimental data in the range of photon virtuality $0.5< Q^2< 10$ GeV$^2/c^2$ are analyzed, including the recent JLab data at 6 GeV electron beam together with the proposal for 12 GeV upgrade. The application of the quantum diffusion model during the formation length of the quark/antiquark $(q\\bar{q})$ pair in the final state of pion reproduces the increase in the nuclear transparency up to the increase of high $Q^2$, showing evidence for color transparency. In particular, through the coherent length of the $\\gamma^*$ fluctuation into $\\rho^0$, the two-step process with the $\\rho N$ scattering cross section chosen to be $\\sigma_{\\rho N}=\\sigma_{\\pi N}$ also contributes to an increase in the nuclear transparency in the low $Q^2$ region. Combined with the one-step process (direct photon coupling) usually adopted in the original formulation of the Glauber theory, this reaction mechanism provides another source of the $Q^2$ dependence of the transparency at low virtualities through the shadowing in the initial state interaction. By the further attenuation due to the shadowing, a better agreement is obtained with the pion transparency measured in the $A(e,e'\\pi^+)$ reaction for $^{12}$C, $^{27}$Al, $^{63}$Cu, and $^{197}$Au nuclei."

At $m_\\pi\\simeq 200$ MeV, our results are consistent with the lattice simulations, and the extrapolations to the physical point, based on the NLO chiral Lagrangians, agree well with existing experimental analyses. We predict qualitatively similar trajectories at LO and up to NLO, consistent with the LO interaction's dominance. At the SU(3) symmetric point of this trajectory, both poles are on the physical sheet, and the lower pole is located at $E^{(1)}=1573(6)(6)$ MeV, becoming a SU(3) singlet, while the higher pole at $E^{(8a)}=1589(7)(5)$ MeV couples to the octet representation. Moreover, we make predictions in $I=1$ for the $\\Sigma^*$ resonance. We find a resonance pole that evolves into a bound state around $m_\\pi=415$~MeV in this sector.

      "summary": "Given the significant uncertainty in the equation of state (EOS) of high-density nuclear matter, establishing EOS-independent universal relations between global properties of neutron stars provides a practical method to constraining unobservable or difficult-to-observe properties using astronomical observations. Constructing universal relations between EOS-dependent properties (e.g., moment of inertia, tidal deformation, etc.) or combined properties (e.g., compactness) is common, and improving the precision of the universal relations may provide stricter constraint on the properties of neutron star. We find that in 3-dimensional space with mass and radius as the base coordinates, the points corresponding to properties of a neutron star described by different EOSs are almost located on the same surface. Thus, the universal relation between the property and the stellar mass-radius can be expressed through describing the surface. We demonstrate that the resulting universal relations have greater precision. For example, we construct high-precision universal relations for the moment of inertia, the f-mode frequency, and the dimensionless tidal deformation with respect to the mass-radius. With the increase in the size and accuracy of NICER observational data for neutron star masses and radii, these universal relations allow for more precise constraints on the unobservable or difficult-to-observe properties."

The inclusion of the transition-strength contribution can reduce nuclear β-decay half-lives by about an order of magnitude, and its effect gradually increases toward the neutron-rich or heavy nuclear regions. For nuclear β-decay half-lives less than 1 s, the empirical formula can describe the experimental data within approximately2 times, which is more accurate than the sophisticated microscopic models. The transition-strength contribution can also be effectively considered by refitting the parameters of other empirical formulas without the transition-strength term although they will still significantly deviate from the new empirical formula in light or heavy neutron-rich nuclear regions. This indicates that the inclusion of the transition-strength contribution in the empirical formula is crucial for the global description of nuclear β-decay half-lives. The extrapolation ability of the new empirical formula was verified by the newly measured β-decay half-lives."

This paper focuses on the most intriguing objects in astronomy, spinning black holes, and investigates the effects of spin on orbital motion. By applying the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to publicly available observational data of the S2 star, our findings indicate that current data fail to constrain the spin of Sgr A . Simulated stars with smaller semi-major axes reveal that the direction of Lense-Thirring precession aligns with the spin direction of Sgr A . Additionally, by incorporating the cosmological constant, which accounts for the expansion of the universe, into our analysis, we establish an upper limit of on the cosmological constant at the confidence level. Future long-term monitoring of S-cluster stars, combined with enhanced observational precision, may enable the determination of the spin of Sgr A and further tighten the bound on the cosmological constant."

Two real cluster models are constructed using the cluster structure of 20Ne nucleus as 5α and α+16O. The real part of the third potential is generated using a CDM3Y6 interaction employed for comparison. Three excited energies to the superposition of the projectile and target states, ground-state (Quasi), 1.6 and 2.5 MeV are investigated using deformed potentials. The contributions of these states are calculated using a one-step distorted wave Born approximation and coupled Channels approaches. Successful calculations and results using semi-microscopic potentials in simple one-channel and coupled channels are obtained. The values of cross section and volume integrals require more contributions to enable more comparisons regarding this project."

We examine the conditions for a bouncing and the existence of an ulterior accelerated phase of the universe. The original concept of Einstein's first paper on cosmology was to modify the equations that control the gravitational metric. Based on this, several authors have proposed different formalisms to modify general relativity. Herein, a function of the topological invariant is used in a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model. First, a case with the topological invariant as a constant is thoroughly examined, yielding specific constraints on the evolution of the Hubble parameter. Subsequently, we study a function of the topological invariant squared. In an empty space-time scenario, the term that modifies Einstein’s equations functions as an effective geometrical density, and we map regions in the phase space in which the effective pressure is positive or negative. This results in non-trivial integral solutions such as cyclic stages of acceleration and deceleration of the scale factor in the model, among other behaviors. We add cosmic dust to the system, and for certain classes of solutions, we observe that the minimum positive value of the Hubble parameter is limited by the cosmic dust matter density. If this matter density reaches zero, the minimum value of the Hubble parameter also reaches zero."

Moreover, starting from the quantum focusing conjecture theory, we obtain another constraint on the blacken factor for which the theory can be satisfied: . In particular, by studying these two constraints, we find common properties. Specifically, we reveal that a universal criterion, manifested in the negativity of the second derivative of , i.e., , in proximity to the event horizon where , ensures the emergence of Page curves and follows the quantum focusing conjecture in a manner transcending specific theoretical models. Finally, we argue that the negativity of the second derivative of the blacken factor near the event horizon strongly indicates negative heat capacity, which implies that black holes with a negative heat capacity must have islands and satisfy the quantum focusing conjecture."

The medium-induced gluon radiation for a massive quark will be suppressed relative to that of a light quark due to the dead-cone effect. The development of new declustering techniques of jet evolution makes a direct study of the dead-cone effect in the QCD medium possible for the first time. In this work, we compute the emission angle distribution of the charm-quark-initiated splittings in D0 meson tagged jet and that of the light parton-initiated splittings in an inclusive jet in p+p and Pb+Pb at 5.02 TeV by utilizing the declustering techniques of jet evolution. The heavy quark propagation and induced energy loss in the QCD medium are simulated with the SHELL model based on the Langevin equation. By directly comparing the emission angle distributions of charm-quark-initiated splittings with those of light parton-initiated splittings at the same energy intervals of the initial parton, we provide insights into the fundamental splitting structure in A+A collisions, thereby exploring the possible observation of the dead-cone effect in medium-induced radiation. We further investigate the case of the emission angle distributions normalized to the number of splittings and find the dead-cone effect will broaden the emission angle of the splitting and reduce the possibility for such splitting to occur, leading the massive parton to lose less energy. We also find that the collisional energy loss mechanism has a negligible impact on the medium modification to the emission angle distribution of the charm-quark-initiated splittings for D0 meson-tagged jets."

An analytic formula expressing the relationship between spectroscopic factors and deformation and polarization, which significantly reduces the deviations of calculated half-lives from experimental data, is proposed as well. Moreover, inspired by the new experimental results for the first proton emitter ever discovered, [L. G. Sarmiento et al., Nat. Commun. 14, 5961 (2023)], we calculate its two proton-emission branches and interpret the partial half-lives. It is noteworthy that this high-spin isomer has some particular characteristics, including diminutive spectroscopic factors and stronger daughter-proton interactions, that considerably enhance the effects of deformation and polarization."

Pan \\emph{et al.} (PRC, 110, 054324, 2024), which was realized in the parameter region from the SU(3) symmetry limit to the O(6) symmetry limit, and seems to be not related to the SU(3) symmetry. However, through the SU(3) analysis, a new technique proposed recently, we found that it is not so. The new mechanism is related to the level-anticrossing phenomenon, which is related to the level-crossing phenomenon in the SU(3) symmetry limit. By incorporating previous ideas, we have a more general explanatory framework for the B(E2) anomaly, which is important for understanding some higher-order interactions in the interacting boson model. Through analysis, it is shown that level-anticrossing in this mechanism mainly results from the third-order interaction $[\\hat{L}\\times \\hat{Q}_{\\chi} \\times \\hat{L}]^{(0)}$. Finally, the B(E2) anomaly in $^{170}$Os is also discussed by this general framework."

The correction terms for the NME are obtained by extending the hadron sector to a higher order in terms of the Rayleigh-Schr\\\"{o}dinger perturbation theory. The NME calculations are performed for the neutrinoless $\\beta\\beta$ ($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$) and the two-neutrino $\\beta\\beta$ ($2\\nu\\beta\\beta$) decays of $^{136}$Xe. The nuclear wave functions are calculated by the quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA) with the Skyrme, the Coulomb, and the contact pairing interactions. Sufficiently large single-particle valence spaces are used. The correction terms for the NME are comparable with the leading term in absolute value, and the sum of the corrections has the opposite sign to that of the leading term. The $g_A^\\mathrm{eff}$'s for the $\\beta\\beta$ NME are calculated by a few methods depending on the truncation of the NME and the half-life referred to. Similarities are found between some of these $g_A^\\mathrm{eff}$'s including those of the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ NME. This leads to the conclusion that the value of $g_A^\\mathrm{eff}$ can indeed be determined by the perturbed transition operator. It is in a comparable range of the $g_A$ for the $2\\nu\\beta\\beta$ NME. The perturbation effect on the $2\\nu\\beta\\beta$ half-life is discussed by comparing the calculated half-lives with the different $g_A$'s and the NME components."

As such, there has been a significant effort to improve their theoretical description. In the small radius limit, inclusive jet production exhibits a universal factorization, enabling the resummation of logarithms which greatly stabilizes theoretical predictions. In this paper, we show how to combine a recently introduced framework for small-$R$ resummation with the STRIPPER subtraction formalism for fragmentation, enabling next-to-next-to-leading order calculations of small-$R$ inclusive jet production for a wide variety of processes at the LHC. We extract the two-loop constants for the jet functions, enabling for the first time next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic resummation matched to next-to-next-to-leading order perturbative calculation. We compare with CMS data for small-$R$ jet production, and find that our results greatly improve the accuracy of the predictions at small-$R$, and stabilize the perturbative convergence and error estimates at larger $R$. Our approach is applicable to a wide class of jet substructure observables exhibiting similar factorization theorems, opening the door to an NNLO jet substructure program at the LHC."

We then analyze the response of the medium to the passage of large-radius $R=2$ jets containing two skinny subjets in gamma-jet events. We introduce novel jet-shape observables that allow us to visualize how the internal structure of large-radius jets shapes the wakes they excite in the QGP. We find that even when the subjets are $\\sim 0.8$ radians apart, the angular shape of the soft hadrons originating from their wake forms a single broad structure. Only when the two subjets are even farther apart are two sub-wakes revealed. We show that the way in which jet structure shapes the structure of jet-induced wakes can be visualized with similar clarity in experiments by using only low-$p_T$ hadrons. The observables we introduce offer a new and distinctive way of seeing jet-induced wakes -- and wake substructure -- in heavy-ion collision data."

Unlike traditional approaches that require imposing constraints to eliminate spurious degrees of freedom, these chiral representations contain exactly the $2j+1$ components needed to describe a spin-$j$ particle. The central objects in the construction are the $t$-tensors, which are generalizations of the Pauli four-vector $\\sigma^\\mu$ for higher spin. For the generalized spinors of these representations, we demonstrate how the algebra of the $t$-tensors allows to formulate a generalization of the Dirac matrix basis for any spin. For on-shell bilinears, we show that a set consisting exclusively of covariant multipoles of order $0\\leq m \\leq 2j$ forms a complete basis. We provide explicit expressions for all bilinears of the generalized Dirac matrix basis, which are valid for any spin value. As a byproduct of our derivations we present an efficient algorithm to compute the $t$-tensor matrix elements. The formalism presented here paves the way to use a more unified approach to analyze the non-perturbative QCD structure of hadrons and nuclei across different spin values, with clear physical interpretation of the resulting distributions as covariant multipoles."

This signals the presence of a new phase of ground-state field structure between the well separated chiral and deconfinement transitions. In this short presentation, we re-examine pure SU(3) gauge theory which provides a foundation for the development of techniques for the examination of full QCD. This time, we reconsider visualisations of the centre-vortex structure in light of the quantitative analysis that demonstrates the first order nature of the deconfinement phase transition in the pure-gauge theory. Here we consider a detailed side-by-side comparison of the field structure slightly below and slightly above the critical temperature. The abrupt changes of the field structure in the first order phase transition are easy to observe in the representative visualisations."

The model reproduces the multiplicity ($N_{ch}$) and pseudo-rapidity distribution reasonably well in minimum-biased d-Au collisions without assuming the formation of a thermalized medium. The invariant yield from Angantyr underpredicts the data in central collisions. We discussed the similarity between the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and data/MC from Angantyr and the possibility of using it as an alternative to check in-medium effects. The data/MC suggests that the central d-Au collisions exhibit signals like baryon enhancement, but no high $p_T$ suppression was found. The d-Au collisions have a much smaller invariant yield than the thermal model calculation for similar $N_{part}$. Based on the available data and simulation results, we argue that a medium may form in the central d-Au collision, but it differs from the perfect QGP formed in Pb-Pb collisions at LHC."

A large set of models is generated using the Markov chain Monte Carlo approach and Bayesian statistics to reproduce nuclear physics knowledge encoded in terms of the nuclear empirical parameters and $\\chi$EFT predictions for low-density neutron matter. These models are filtered, in a second step, using astrophysical constraints: the tidal deformability obtained from GW170817 parameter estimation and the observational masses deduced from radio-astronomy. We then obtain a set of selected RMF models that are compatible with present nuclear and astrophysical constraints and that can be employed to make predictions and to quantity their uncertainties. Predictions for masses and radii are compared to NICER masses-radii analyses for PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620. We find that RMF models can be made soft enough to predict low values for neutron star radii compatible with GW170817 and, at larger densities, stiff enough to be compatible with NICER analyses for massive neutron stars. Our models can also reach large values for the maximum mass, up to 2.6$M_\\odot$. In addition, for the core composition, we obtain a large distribution of the proton fraction for canonical mass neutron stars, some of them allowing the direct URCA fast cooling process. For massive neutron stars, however, most of our models suggest a large proton fraction in the core allowing direct URCA fast cooling process."

Such an pseudo-magnetic field is generated always in the dynamics of any nucleus, but its effects on Cooper pairs is significantly enhanced in the dynamic evolution of nuclei with an odd number of nucleons. We present for the first time a microscopic study of the induced fission of the odd neutron compound nuclei $^{239}$U, $^{241, 243}$Pu, and the odd proton, odd neutron compound nucleus $^{238}$Np, performed within the time-dependent density functional theory extended to superfluid fermion systems, without any simplifying assumptions and with controlled numerical approximations, and for a very large number of initial conditions. Due to the presence of the unpaired odd nucleon(s), the time-reversal symmetry of the fission compound nucleus is spontaneously broken, an aspect routinely neglected in the most advanced microscopic approaches of the past. The emerging fission fragment properties are quite similar to the properties of fission fragments of neighboring even-even nuclei. The time from saddle-to-scission is often significantly longer in odd-N-odd-Z or odd-A nuclei than for even-even nuclei since systems with unpaired nucleons are easier to excite and the potential energy surfaces of these nuclei have more structure, often resembling a very complicated obstacle course, rather than a more direct evolution of the nuclear shape from the top of the outer fission barrier to the scission configuration. The Pauli blocking approximation, often invoked in the literature, expected to inhibit the fission of nuclei with unpaired nucleons, is surprisingly strongly violated during the fission dynamics."

This interpretation is supported by several phenomenological models and theoretical estimates of the nuclear orbiting timescale and cross-section, inelastic scattering cross section including both nuclear and Coulomb excitation, and the Wigner-Smith time delay. We demonstrate that a multi-photon exchange during nuclear orbiting is responsible for an atomic excitation. Furthermore, proximity of the projectile and target nucleus during the nuclear orbiting modifies the effective charge of the projectile. Even though this orbiting induced excitation is triggered in zeptoseconds, it can still be observed in the attosecond time scale because of the Wigner-Smith time delay inherent to autoionization. Thus, we demonstrate the crossover between the zeptosecond and attosecond time scales which are native to nuclear and atomic physics, respectively. Markedly, this crossover may be the reason for x-ray production from ultra short nuclear processes ($\\leq 10^{-21}$ sec). This explanation is likely to resolve the fission time scale anomaly and can stimulate cross-disciplinary research ranging from solid state to high-energy physics."

As a top-down approach in gauge-gravity duality, the D(-1)-branes are instantons and violate the CP symmetry in the dual theory. The background geometry of this model contains black brane (deconfined geometry) and bubble D3-brane solutions (confined geometry), all with a non-zero Romand-Romand zero form as axion. The dual theories to the backgrounds are respectively the Super Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature and three-dimensional confining Yang-Mills theory, all with a Chern-Simons term induced by instantons. In the confined geometry, we introduce a baryon vertex as a D5-brane wrapped on $S^{5}$, then identify the fermionic flux on the D7-brane as a baryonic operator. Afterwards, we study the spectrum and the holographic correlation function of the flavored fermion on the D7-branes. Remarkably, the fermionic spectrum is in agreement with the dispersion curves obtained from the confined correlation function, and the mass ratio of the lowest baryon and meson in our model is close to the associated experimental data. Moreover, the effective interaction terms of the holographic baryon and meson are derived and all the coupling constants take order of $N_{c}^{1/2}$ agreeing with the evaluation from the large N field theory. In the deconfined geometry, the holographic correlation function is also evaluated numerically while the fermion on D7-brane is identified to plasmino instead of baryon. The dispersion curves from the deconfined correlation function basically covers the results from the hard thermal loop approximation and may imply the instanton-induced interaction with spin. Overall, this work constructs a holographic theory about baryonic fermion and mesonic boson with instantons or CP violation."

In this work, we show that the universality of KNO scaling can be extended to hadron-hadron collisions when restricted to QCD jets. We present a comprehensive study of KNO scaling in QCD jets produced in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. Using perturbative QCD calculations in the double logarithmic approximation and PYTHIA simulations, we find that KNO scaling approximately holds for both quark and gluon jets across a broad jet $p_T$ range, from $0.1$ TeV to $2.5$ TeV, at both the parton and hadron levels. Especially, we highlight characteristic differences between the KNO scaling functions of quark and gluon jets, with the quark-jet scaling function lying above that of gluon jets at both low and high multiplicities. This distinction is essential for interpreting inclusive jet data at the LHC.

      "summary": "arXiv:2404.06323v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Constraining the equation of state (EOS) of strongly interacting, dense matter is the focus of intense experimental, observational, and theoretical effort. Chiral effective field theory ($\\chi$EFT) can describe the EOS between the typical densities of nuclei and those in the outer cores of neutron stars while perturbative QCD (pQCD) can be applied to properties of deconfined quark matter, both with quantified theoretical uncertainties. However, describing the full range of densities in between with a single EOS that has well-quantified uncertainties is a challenging problem. Bayesian multi-model inference from $\\chi$EFT and pQCD can help bridge the gap between the two theories. In this work, we introduce a correlated Bayesian model mixing framework that uses a Gaussian Process (GP) to assimilate different information into a single QCD EOS for symmetric nuclear matter. The present implementation uses a stationary GP to infer this mixed EOS solely from the EOSs of $\\chi$EFT and pQCD while accounting for the truncation errors of each theory. The GP is trained on the pressure as a function of number density in the low- and high-density regions where $\\chi$EFT and pQCD are, respectively, valid. We impose priors on the GP kernel hyperparameters to suppress unphysical correlations between these regimes. This, together with the assumption of stationarity, results in smooth $\\chi$EFT-to-pQCD curves for both the pressure and the speed of sound. We show that using uncorrelated mixing requires uncontrolled extrapolation of at least one of $\\chi$EFT or pQCD into regions where the perturbative series breaks down and leads to an acausal EOS. We also discuss extensions of this framework to non-stationary and less differentiable GP kernels, its future application to neutron-star matter, and the incorporation of additional constraints from nuclear theory, experiment, and multi-messenger astronomy."

A principal measurement is coherent exclusive vector meson (VM) production in diffractive $eA$ collisions. The gluon spatial distribution inside the nucleus can be obtained through a Fourier transform of the nuclear momentum transfer ($|t|$) distribution for these VMs. However, the $|t|$ distribution is one of the most challenging measurements at the EIC. This research aims to overcome one of the main obstacles in this measurement: limited precision in measuring $|t|$, making it difficult to resolve the diffractive pattern from coherent events. We employ a method for reconstructing $|t|$ by utilizing the electron beam polarization in $eA$ collisions and measuring the projected $|t|$ distribution to overcome this complication. Through the study of diffractive VM production, we carry out an experimental simulation of how the detector effect would change the extracted nuclear geometry and how to use projective techniques to avoid defects. This technique will allow us to measure the diffractive pattern in coherent events more precisely, providing a potential solution for a critical measurement that is difficult for the EIC baseline detector."

Historically, these reactions have been attributed to the production of high-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. We estimate the photoproduction off of protons in the context of gamma-ray bursts, where it is expected there will be sufficient baryonic material that may be encompassing or entrained in the jet. We show that typical stellar baryonic material, even material completely devoid of neutrons, can become inundated with neutrons in situ via hadronic photoproduction. Consequently, this mechanism provides a means for collapsars and other astrophysical sites containing substantial flux of high-energy photons to be favorable for neutron-capture nucleosynthesis."

This effect is studied in the general framework of the self-consistent time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theory, treating the crust as a perfect crystal. The superfluid fraction is derived in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer approximation for superfluid velocities much smaller than Landau's critical velocity within the linear-response theory. The different assumptions made in previous studies are clarified. Fully three-dimensional band-structure calculations of superfluid neutrons in a body-centered cubic lattice are carried out. Although the formation of Cooper pairs is essential for the occurrence of superfluidity, the superfluid fraction is found to be insensitive to the pairing gap, as in uniform neutron matter. In the intermediate region of the inner crust at the average baryon number density 0.03 fm$^{-3}$, only 8\\% of the free neutrons are found to participate to the superflow. Such very low superfluid fraction challenges the classical interpretation of pulsar frequency glitches and calls for more systematic calculations within the full HFB approach."

We outline strategies for solving the coupled system, including a novel approach to managing the infinite hierarchy and handling the non-integer moments. We show a significant influence of momentum dependent relaxation time on the time evolution of the moments, particularly for higher-order moments and system with smaller shear viscosity over entropy density, emphasizing the importance of incorporating such dependence for a more accurate description of the system dynamics with low shear viscosity such as the quark-gluon-plasma produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions."

This difference emerges from the shift of the nucleon pole mass in medium, which is generated in the nucleon channel of the quark gap equation. We prove that such a difference is precisely the contour contribution from the shift of the nucleon pole. The resulting discontinuity manifests as a first-order phase transition and fundamentally determines both the nuclear binding energy and the saturation density. We then derive an analytical relation between the binding energy and the sigma term of the nucleon, yielding a binding energy of $E/A=15.9\\,\\textrm{MeV}$.

The hexaquark is included as a new degree of freedom in the hadronic phase, and its influence on the deconfinement transition to quark matter is explored. We re-parametrize the CMF model to ensure compatibility with recent astrophysical constraints, including the observation of massive pulsars and gravitational wave events. Our results show that the presence of $d^*$ significantly modifies the EoS, leading to a softening at high densities and a consequent reduction in the predicted maximum stellar masses. Furthermore, we examine the possibility of a first-order deconfinement phase transition within the context of the extended stability branch of slow stable HSs (SSHSs). We find that the presence of hexaquarks can delay the deconfinement phase transition and reduce the associated energy density gap, affecting the structure and stability of HSs. Our results suggest that, as the hexaquark appearance tends to destabilize stellar configurations, fine tuning of model parameters is required to obtain both the presence of hexaquarks and quark deconfinement in these systems. In this scenario, the SSHS branch plays a crucial role in obtaining HSs with hexaquarks that satisfy current astrophysical constraints.

The nonperturbative scattering with the target nucleus is expressed in terms of the dipole amplitude, which also describes nonlinear gluon saturation effects. The TEEC observable is computed in the RHIC and LHC kinematics, and we show that it can be sensitive to the dipole amplitude, making it a potentially good observable for studying saturation effects."

      "summary": "arXiv:2504.00101v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We derive a factorization formula for inclusive jet production in heavy-ion collisions using the tools of Effective Field Theory (EFT). We show how physics at widely separated scales in this process can be systematically separated by matching to EFTs at successively lower virtualities. Owing to a strong scale separation, we recover a vacuum-like DGLAP evolution above the jet scale, while the additional low-energy scales induced by the medium effectively probe the internal structure of the jet. As a result, the cross section can be written as a series with an increasing number of subjets characterized by perturbative matching coefficients each of which is convolved with a {\\it distinct} function. These functions encode broadening, medium-induced radiations as well as quantum interference such as the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect and color coherence dynamics to all orders in perturbation theory. As a first application of this EFT framework, we investigate the case of an unresolved jet and show how the cross section can be factorized and fully separate the jet dynamics from the universal physics of the medium. To compare to the existing literature, we explicitly compute the medium jet function at next-to-leading order in the coupling and leading order in medium opacity."

Its main goals include searches for eV-scale sterile neutrinos as part of the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) program, other searches for physics beyond the Standard Model, and precision studies of neutrino-argon interactions. In addition, SBND is providing a platform for LArTPC neutrino detector technology development and is an excellent training ground for the international group of scientists and engineers working towards the upcoming flagship Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). SBND began operation in July 2024, and started collecting stable neutrino beam data in December 2024 with an unprecedented rate of ~7,000 neutrino events per day. During its currently approved operation plans (2024-2027), SBND is expected to accumulate nearly 10 million neutrino interactions. The near detector dataset will be instrumental in testing the sterile neutrino hypothesis with unprecedented sensitivity in SBN and in probing signals of beyond the Standard Model physics. It will also be used to significantly advance our understanding of the physics of neutrino-argon interactions ahead of DUNE. After the planned accelerator restart at Fermilab (2029+), opportunities are being explored to operate SBND in antineutrino mode in order to address the scarcity of antineutrino-argon scattering data, or in a dedicated beam-dump mode to significantly enhance sensitivity to searches for new physics. SBND is an international effort, with approximately 40% of institutions from Europe, contributing to detector construction, commissioning, software development, and data analysis. Continued European involvement and leadership are essential during SBND's operations and analysis phase for both the success of SBND, SBN and its role leading up to DUNE."

In the present work, we adopt a more robust methodology compared to an earlier work along the same lines for analytically evaluating the loop-integrations, and incorporate important corrections at next-to-next-to-leading order. These include the proton's structure effects which renormalize the proton-photon interaction vertices and the proton's propagator.

In the vacuum environment, the QCD evolution of this TMD fragmentation function is governed by the Collins-Soper equation. However, in the presence of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium, the jet-medium interaction induces a transverse-momentum-broadening effect that modifies the QCD evolution. As a result, the transverse spin polarization of $\\Lambda$ hyperons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions differs from that in $pp$ collisions. We demonstrate that this difference serves as a sensitive probe for studying jet-medium interaction, offering a novel perspective through the spin degree of freedom."

We find that the peak of sound velocity emerges naturally in the intermediate density region -- $(1\\sim 2.5)n_0$ -- without resorting to any transitions from hadron to exotic configurations or introducing new degrees of freedom. This phenomenon is not found in the Walecka-type models where the sigma meson is included in the linear-type approach, therefore, it is an intrinsic character of the dilaton compensator approach through the matching of QCD trace anomaly, and it connects to the character of the lightest scalar meson. In addition, these observations shed light on how the hidden scale symmetry manifests in nuclear medium from the unitarity limit in dilute matter to dilaton limit in compact star matter."

I here construct a simple schematic model which simulates this phenomenon. The model consists of a random matrix Hamiltonian based on the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), which is coupled to an entrance channel Hamiltonian in the discrete basis representation. I show that the transmission coefficients are almost unity when both the level density and the decay widths of the GOE configurations are large, realizing the strong absorption regime. On the other hand, when these parameters are small, the transmission coefficients are significantly structured as a function of energy. In that situation, the transmission coefficients at resonance energies reach unity in this model, that is consistent with the experimental finding of the cross section deficit."

While the model space was restricted only to seniority zero configurations in the previous applications of the NEGF method, we remove this restriction and include seniority non-zero configurations as well. In such model space, a proton-neutron interaction is active, for which we introduce a random interaction. We find that the seniority non-zero configurations significantly increase the fission cross sections, and thus the fission-to-capture branching ratios, even though they are still underestimated by about one order of magnitude as compared to the experimental data. In addition, we also find that the fission dynamics is governed by only a small number of eigenstates of the model Hamiltonian."

Many models, however, rely on energy functionals based on assumptions that have not been rigorously validated. We critically analyze a commonly used ansatz for confinement, where the energy functional scales with density as $U \\propto n^{\\frac{2}{3}}$ . Our findings, derived from a systematic non-local energy functional, reveal that this scaling does not capture the dynamics of confinement. Instead, the energy functional evolves from $n^2$ at low densities to $n$ at high densities, governed by an infrared cutoff. These results suggest that models relying on such assumptions should be revisited to ensure more reliable EoS construction."

In recent years, it has been argued that the NMEs of cMDMs can be related to the third moment of the nucleon's higher-twist (specifically, twist-three) parton distribution function (PDF) $e(x)$, which can, in principle, be measured through dihadron production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering processes. By applying the spin-flavor expansion to the cMDM operators in the large-$N_c$ limit, where $N_c$ is the number of quark colors, we show that the NMEs receive contributions not only from the twist-three PDF $e(x)$ but also from an additional, previously neglected nucleon form factor. Incorporating constraints from the spin-flavor expansion, recent experimental data on $e(x)$, as well as model calculations of $e(x)$, we estimate the NMEs of the cMDM operators. Our analysis indicates that the NMEs are dominated by the nucleon form factors, and the cMDM contributions to pion-nucleon couplings can be comparable to those from the quark sigma terms."

In our work we focus on two stages, directly after the supernova shock wave moves outwards, where neutrinos are still captured in the core and the lepton per baryon ratio is fixed to $Y_L = 0.4$, and a few seconds afterwards, when all neutrinos have left the star. All nuclear equations of state used for this purpose fulfill the binding energy constraints from chiral effective field theory for neutron matter at zero temperature. We find for the neutrino-trapped case higher minimal masses than for the case when neutrinos have left the proto-neutron star. Thermal effects, here in the form of a given constant entropy per baryon $s$, have a smaller effect on increasing the minimal mass. The minimal proto-neutron star mass for the first evolutionary stage with $Y_L = 0.4$ and $s = 1$ amounts to $M_{min} \\sim 0.62M_{\\odot}$ and for the stage without neutrinos and $s = 2$ to $M_{min} \\sim 0.22M_{\\odot}$ rather independent on the nuclear equation of state used. We also study the case related to an accretion induced collapse of a white dwarf where the initial lepton fraction is $Y_L = 0.5$ and observe large discrepancies in the results of the different tables of nuclear equations of state used. Our finding points towards a thermodynamical inconsistent treatment of the nuclear liquid-gas phase transition for nuclear equations of state in tabular form demanding a fully generalized three-dimensional Gibbs construction for a proper treatment. Finally, we demonstrate that there is a universal relation for the increase of the proto-neutron star minimal mass with the lepton fraction for all nuclear equations of state used."

We refit three representative RMF parameter sets (DD-ME2, PKDD, NL3), considering the uncertainties in nuclear matter saturation properties. Utilizing the resulting star structure, composition and nucleon properties in the medium obtained in a consistent manner, we calculate the pinning energy of superfluid vortex in the nuclear lattice in the inner crust. This leads to the evolution of associated pinning force that acts on the vortex, which can be confronted with observed glitch amplitude and short-time relaxation in the 2000 Vela glitch event, following the snowplow model of pulsar glitch. We discuss how the vortex configuration and pinning properties depend on the nuclear parameters, and find an interesting and dominant role of the nuclear symmetry energy slope on pinning strength."

Compared to the traditionally used Walecka-type models in nuclear matter studies, our approach improves the behavior of symmetry energy and the incompressibility coefficient in describing empirical data without introducing additional freedoms. Moreover, the predicted neutron star structures fall within the constraints of GW170817, PSR J0740+6620, and PSR J0030+0451, while the maximum neutron star mass can reach about $~3M_{\\odot}$ with a pure hadronic phase.

We find nearly identical suppression for central $p / d + A$ collisions as for peripheral $A + A$ collisions, quantitatively consistent with the measured 20% suppression of neutral pions produced in $d + \\mathrm{Au}$ collisions by PHENIX, but dramatically inconsistent with the measured 20% enhancement of charged hadrons produced in $p + \\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions by ATLAS.

We demonstrate that neglecting the dependence on the impact parameter can result in overestimated saturation effects for protons, while it has little effect for heavy nuclei at the energies available at current experiments. When fixing the nonperturbative parameters to the energy dependence of the exclusive $J/\\psi$ photoproduction cross section with proton targets, predictions for lead targets are not sensitive to the applied running-coupling prescription, the scheme chosen to resum large transverse logarithms in the BK equation, or the infrared regulator in the evolution."

Modern astronomy is increasingly operating under a holistic approach, probing the same question with multiple diagnostics including how sources vary over time, how they appear across the electromagnetic spectrum, and through their other signatures, including gravitational waves, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and dust on Earth. Astrophysical observations are now reaching the point where approximate physics models are insufficient. Key sources of interest are explosive transients, whose understanding requires multidisciplinary studies at the intersection of astrophysics, gravity, nuclear science, plasma physics, fluid dynamics and turbulence, computation, particle physics, atomic, molecular, and optical science, condensed matter and materials science, radiation transport, and high energy density physics. This white paper provides an overview of the major scientific advances that lay at the intersection of physics and astronomy and are best probed through time-domain and multimessenger astrophysics, an exploration of how multidisciplinary science can be fostered, and introductory descriptions of the relevant scientific disciplines and key astrophysical sources of interest."

Recently, the NA61/SHINE collaboration reported an unexpectedly large isospin-violating charged-to-neutral kaon ratio in Ar-Sc heavy-ion collisions (HIC).Using a quark recombination approach, we introduce a function of kaon multiplicities that reduces to unity in the isospin-symmetric limit independently of the scattering energy and type of nuclei. Using this quantity, we show that nucleus-nucleus collisions violate isospin sizably (at the $6.4\\sigma$--level), while proton-proton data on kaon multiplicities do not. We predict other isospin-violating enhancements in HIC, such as the proton-to-neutron ratio $p/n \\sim 1.2$ and the hyperon ratio $\\Sigma^{+}/\\Sigma^{-}\\sim1.4$. Finally, we extend the approach to antiquarks in the initial state, useful for e.g. pion-nucleus scattering reactions."

As the collision beam energy $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ decreases to approach the two-nucleon-mass threshold, this initial angular momentum approaches zero. One may thus expect that the observed global spin polarization should reach a maximum and then drop to zero as increased stopping competes with decreased initial momentum. Recent experimental measurements, however, appear to show a continual rise of hyperon polarization even down to $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} =$ 2.42 GeV, suggesting a peak very near threshold which is difficult to interpret and calls for a better understanding of angular momentum initial conditions, especially at low energy. Here, we develop a new Glauber-based initial state model (\"Glauber+\") to investigate the initial distribution of angular momentum with respect to rapidity as well as the dependence of this distribution on initial baryon stopping across a wide range of collisional beam energy. We estimate that the angular momentum per produced final charged particle at mid-rapidity peaks around 5 GeV, which may present a potential challenge to an interpretation of the spin polarization measurements near threshold as being a consequence of the initial angular momentum of the colliding system."

The first set of calculation solves the pn-QRPA equations using the schematic model (SM) approach. The Woods-Saxon potential was employed as a mean-field basis. A spherical shape assigned for each waiting point nuclei throughout all simulations. Both allowed Gamow-Teller (GT) and first-forbidden (FF) transitions were considered in the particle-hole (ph) channel. The second set uses the pn-QRPA model in deformed Nilsson basis to calculate $\\beta$-decay rates for allowed GT and unique first-forbidden (U1F) transitions under terrestrial and stellar conditions. Our results are in agreement with shell model findings that first-forbidden transitions lead to a considerable decrement in the calculated half-lives of the isotones.

Prior to the collapse, lepton emissions significantly affect the cooling of the core and reduce its entropy. Therefore, the lepton emission rates for Fe-group nuclei serve as an important input for core-collapse simulations of high-mass stars.\n  From earlier simulation studies, isotopes of vanadium (V) have great astrophysical significance in regard to their weak-decay rates, which substantially affect $Y_e$ (fraction of lepton to baryon number) during the final developmental stages of massive stars. The current study involves the computation of the weak lepton emission (LE) rates for V isotopes by employing the improved deformed proton-neutron Quasi-particle Random Phase Approximation (pn-QRPA) model. The mass numbers of the selected isotopes range from 43 to 64. The LE rates on these isotopes have been estimated for a broad spectrum of density and temperature under astrophysical conditions. The ranges considered for density and temperature are $10^1$ to $10^{11}$ (g/cm$^3$) and $10^7$ to $3 \\times 10^{11}$ (K), respectively.\n  The lepton emission rates from the present study were also compared to the rates previously estimated by using the independent-particle model (IPM) and large-scale shell model (LSSM). IPM rates are generally bigger than QRPA rates, while LSSM rates overall show a good comparison with the reported rates."

In this work, a multilayer perceptron and autoencoder (MLP + AE) hybrid neural network method is introduced to extract preformation factors within the generalized liquid drop model and experimental data. A K-fold cross validation method is also adopted. The accuracy of the preformation factor calculated by this improved neural network is comparable to the results of the empirical formula. MLP + AE can effectively capture the linear relationship between the logarithm of the preformation factor and the square root of the ratio of the decay energy, further verifying that Geiger-Nuttall law can deal with preformation factor. The extracted preformation probability of isotope and isotone chains show different trends near the magic number, and in addition, an odd-even staggering effect appears. This means that the preformation factors are affected by closed shells and unpaired nucleons. Therefore the preformation factors can provide nuclear structure information. Furthermore, for 41 new nuclides, the half-lives introduced with the preformation factors reproduce the experimental values as expected. Finally, the preformation factors and {\\alpha}-decay half-lives of Z = 119 and 120 superheavy nuclei are predicted."

Measurements have been performed at RHIC and LHC, but the conclusion has been elusive in the absence of quantitative calculations for both scenarios. We address this issue by employing a recently developed formalism of density correlations and incorporate resonance decays, local charge conservation, and experimental kinematic cuts. We find that the hadron gas scenario is in fair agreement with the ALICE data for $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions only when a very short rapidity range of local charge conservation is enforced, while the QGP scenario is in excellent agreement with experimental data and largely insensitive to the range of local charge conservation. A Bayesian analysis of the data utilizing different priors yields moderate evidence for the freeze-out of charge fluctuations in the QGP phase relative to hadron gas. The upcoming high-fidelity measurements from LHC Run 2 will serve as a precision test of the two scenarios."

The formalism adopted here involves calculation of the in-medium potential of the HQ in a weak magnetic field, which then serves as a proxy for the resummed gluon propagator in the calculation of HQ self-energy ($\\Sigma$). The self-energy determines the scattering rate of HQs with light thermal partons, which is subsequently used to evaluate $\\kappa$ and $D_s$. It is observed that non-perturbative effects play a dominant role at low temperature. The spatial diffusion coefficient $2\\pi T D_s$, exhibits good agreement with recent LQCD results. These findings can be applied to calculate the heavy quark directed flow at RHIC and LHC energies. An extension of this formalism to the case of finite HQ momentum has also been attempted."

Understanding this process is crucial not only for nuclear physics but also for astrophysical studies, where the production of rare antinuclei could serve as a probe for new physics. This work presents a three-body coalescence model based on the Wigner function formalism, offering a refined description of light-nucleus production. By incorporating realistic two- and three-body nuclear interaction potentials constrained by modern scattering and femtoscopic correlation data, our approach improves on traditional coalescence models. The framework is validated using event generators applied to proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV to predict the momentum spectra of light (anti) nuclear nuclei with mass number $A=3$, which are then compared with the experimental data from ALICE. Our results demonstrate the sensitivity of light nucleus yields to the choice of nuclear wave functions, emphasizing the importance of an accurate description of the coalescence process. This model lays the foundation for the extension of coalescence studies of $A=3$ light nuclei to a wider range of collision systems and energies."

      "summary": "Quantum chromodynamics admits a CP violating contribution to the action, the θ term, which is expected to give rise to a nonvanishing electric dipole moment of the neutron. Despite intensive search, no CP violations have been found in the strong interaction. This puzzle is referred to as the strong CP problem. There is evidence that CP is conserved in the confining theory, to the extent that color charges are totally screened for θ > 0 at large distances. It is not immediately obvious that this implies a vanishing dipole moment though. With this Letter I will close the gap. It is shown that in the infinite volume hadron correlation functions decouple from the topological charge, expressed in terms of the zero modes. The reason is that hadrons have a limited range of interaction, while the density of zero modes vanishes with the inverse root of the volume, thus reducing the probability of finding a zero mode in the vicinity to zero. This implies that CP is conserved in the strong interaction."

The observation of this low mass compact star dictates the use of softer equation of state which on the contrary cannot explain the massive compact stars. This poses a new challenge for the astrophysicists in their search for the equation of state of compact objects. The hybrid equations of state are constructed using the IUFSU parametrization based on the relativistic mean field (RMF) theory for the hadronic part and the generic constant speed of sound parametrization (CSS) for the phase transition to quark matter.The CSS framework is characterized by three key parameters, namely the transition density $(\\rho_{tr})$, the energy jumps $(\\Delta\\varepsilon)$ and the speed of sound $(C_s)$. Here, our primary aim is to investigate the influence of individual CSS parameters on the formation of a object of small mass and radius compatible with HESS J1731-347 parameters.

However, its post-form representation presents significant numerical challenges due to the absence of a natural cutoff in the transition matrix integration. This work presents a systematic assessment of convergence methods for post-form IAV calculations, comparing the bin method and the Vincent-Fortune approach. We demonstrate that while the bin method offers implementation simplicity, it exhibits strong parameter dependence that compromises numerical stability. In contrast, the Vincent-Fortune method, which employs complex contour integration, achieves reliable convergence without arbitrary parameters. We further introduce a novel hybrid approach that integrates finite-range distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) with the Vincent-Fortune technique, combining the accuracy of finite-range treatment at short distances with the numerical stability of zero-range approximations in the asymptotic region. Numerical results for deuteron and $^6$Li-induced reactions confirm the efficacy of this hybrid method, showing consistent agreement with experimental data while eliminating the convergence issues that plague traditional approaches. This advancement enables more reliable calculations of nonelastic breakup cross sections and facilitates the extension of the IAV formalism beyond DWBA to incorporate continuum-discretized coupled-channels (CDCC) wave functions for a more comprehensive treatment of breakup processes."

The FN constraints explicitly imposed through the binding energies and charge radii of selected nuclei are found to significantly affect the EoS across different densities. However, the high computational cost of these constraints makes it challenging to extend the analysis to a broader set of nuclei, particularly when the objective is not merely to obtain a single optimized model but to systematically explore uncertainties in global modeling. To overcome this challenge, we introduce NucleiML (NML), a machine learning framework trained on ground-state FN properties obtained from mean-field models. Integrated into a Bayesian inference approach, NML demonstrates high accuracy and strong consistency with the underlying mean-field model. The NML achieves around ten-fold computational speed-up, from $\\sim 4.5$ hours to 30 minutes.

The constructed observables provide physical insight into optimal CME detection strategies, and offer a promising path forward for experimental searches of CME at RHIC and the LHC."

The expressions in the two cases have the same form, but the coefficients are governed by different functions. The relative differences between the tensor coefficients in the Fermi-Dirac and Boltzmann cases are found to grow exponentially with the baryon chemical potential.

Quite recently, the elastic breakup cross section data were reanalyzed with the continuum-discretized coupled channels method (CDCC) assuming a $p+{\\rm ^{8}B}$ two-body model for $^9$C and the $S_{18}$ was modified. It was not well justified, however, to treat $^8$B as an inert nucleus given its proton separation energy is only 137~keV. We reexamine the elastic breakup of $^9$C by the four-body CDCC with a $p+p+{\\rm ^{7}Be}$ three-body model for $^9$C and evaluate $S_{18}$. To achieve this, we propose a method to disentangle the $p+{\\rm ^{8}B}+{\\rm ^{208}Pb}$ three-body channel in the four-body CDCC calculation, for the first time. We calculate the elastic breakup cross section of $^9$C off a $^{208}$Pb target at 65~MeV/nucleon. The obtained breakup cross sections are decomposed into the contributions of the $p+{\\rm ^{8}B}+{\\rm ^{208}Pb}$ and $p+p+{\\rm ^{7}Be}+{\\rm ^{208}Pb}$ channels by using the solution of the complex-scaled Lippmann--Schwinger equation. The breakup cross section to the $p+{\\rm ^{8}B}+{\\rm ^{208}Pb}$ channel reproduces well the shape of the experimental data in the low breakup energy region, which is important for determining $S_{18}$. By fitting the theoretical result to the experimental data, the asymptotic normalization coefficient of $^9$C for the $p+{\\rm ^{8}B}$ configuration is determined and we obtain $S_{18}=38.4\\pm1.1$ eVb. This result is smaller than the previous value obtained with the three-body CDCC by about 45\\%. Thus, our new results suggest the necessity of taking into account the fragile nature of $^{8}$B in the $^{9}$C breakup."

We aim to generalize the Fermi Operator Expansion (FOE) method that is effective for finite-temperature coordinate-space simulation, from the Hartree-Fock theory to Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theory including the pairing effects. Furthermore, the periodic structure with free neutrons in the inner crust requires us to treat the system with the band theory. We give a concise proof that the generalized density matrix in the HFB theory can be obtained with the FOE. The Chebyshev polynomial expansion is used for calculations of the HFB band theory. Using a model for a slab phase of the inner crust, the FOE method produces results in good agreement with those based on the diagonalization of the HFB Hamiltonian. The FOE method for the HFB band theory is a powerful tool for studying the non-trivial exotic structures in neutron stars. The FOE method is suitable for parallelization and further acceleration is possible with nearsightedness."

Recent studies suggest that at least large pairing gaps in the CFL phase are incompatible with current astrophysical observations of neutron stars. At the same time, it has recently been shown that in two-flavor quark matter, subleading corrections from pairing effects can be much larger than would be na\\\"ively expected, even for comparatively small gaps. In the present Letter, we compute next-to-leading-order corrections to the pressure of quark matter in the CFL phase arising from the gap and the strong coupling constant, incorporating neutron-star equilibrium conditions and current state-of-the-art perturbative QCD results.

When adding only one resonance, the best result is to add one $N(3/2^-)$ resonance around $2097$ MeV, which substantially reduce the $\\chi^2$ per degree of freedom to $1.35$.

Using correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge (CG), we computed the quasi-TMD beam function for a pion with a mass of 300 MeV, a fine lattice spacing of $a = 0.06$ fm and multiple large momenta up to 3 GeV. The intrinsic soft functions in the CG approach are extracted from form factors with large momentum transfer, and as a byproduct, we also obtain the corresponding Collins-Soper (CS) kernel. Our determinations of both the soft function and the CS kernel agree with perturbation theory at small transverse separations ($b_\\perp$) between the quarks. At larger $b_\\perp$, the CS kernel remains consistent with recent results obtained using both CG and gauge-invariant TMD correlators in the literature. By combining next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) factorization of the quasi-TMD beam function and the soft function, we obtain $x$-dependent pion valence-quark TMDPDF for transverse separations $b_\\perp \\gtrsim 1$ fm.

The theoretical model parameters are determined by fitting them to the total cross sections of the process $e^+e^-\\to B \\bar{B}$, and it is found that the current experimental data on the baryon electromagnetic form factors in the time-like region can be well reproduced. In addition to the total cross sections, the electromagnetic form factors $G_E$ and $G_M$, and the charge radii of those baryons are also estimated, which are in agreement with the experimental data. On the other hand, we have also investigated the nonmonotonic behavior of the time-like baryon electromagnetic form factors, and it is found that the previously proposed periodic behaviour of the nucleon time-like electromagnetic form factor is not confirmed. However, we do observe the nonmonotonic structures in the line shape of the baryon effective form factors or the ratio $|G_E/G_M|$ for the charmed baryon $\\Lambda^+_c$.

While exact evaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of active nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex nuclei. The broadly-applicable Pauli-String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe-) MCMC technique is introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed nuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $\\sim 8$ for some nuclei. Significant multi-nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$-shell, dominated by proton-neutron configurations, along with significant measures of magic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on the path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion. These results indicate that quantum-computing resources will accelerate precision simulations of such nuclei and beyond."

This observation is known as strangeness enhancement in heavy-ion collisions and is considered one of the important signatures that can signify the formation of QGP. However, in addition to strangeness enhancement, recent measurements hint at observing several heavy-ion-like features in high multiplicity pp collisions at energies available at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Alternatively, event shape observables, such as transverse spherocity, transverse sphericity, charged particle flattenicity, and relative transverse activity classifiers, can fundamentally separate hard interaction-dominated jetty events from soft isotropic events. These features of event shape observables can probe the observed heavy-ion-like features in pp collisions with significantly reduced selection bias and can bring all collision systems on equal footing. In this article, we present an extensive summary of the strange particle ratios to pions as a function of different event classifiers using the PYTHIA~8 model with color reconnection and rope hadronization mechanisms to understand the microscopic origin of strangeness enhancement in pp collisions and also prescribe the applicability of these event classifiers in the context of strangeness enhancement. Charged particle flattenicity is found to be most suited for the study of strangeness enhancement, and it shows a quantitative enhancement similar to that seen for the analysis based on the number of multi-parton interactions."

We confirm that the imaginary part of the photon polarization tensor correctly reproduces the known result from the independent calculation. We utilize the Kramers-Kronig relation to estimate the real part numerically as a function of the momenta, the chemical potential, and the finite temperature. As an application, we consider the real photon limit and estimate the photon decay rate and the Stokes parameter in the hot and dense medium. We specifically quantify the difference between the X-mode and the O-mode with the polarization orthogonal and parallel to the magnetic field. As long as the magnetic field is weak, the decay rate of the X-mode photon is larger than that of the O-mode photon, while the O-mode becomes dominant due to the Landau level suppression of the X-mode at a strong magnetic field. We also find that the eigenmodes of the propagating photon change their polarization state with increasing density."

In this work, a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the two-body particle-particle propagator is derived within the linear-response formalism using a pairing field and anomalous propagators. This framework allows us to compute kernels corresponding to different self-energy approximations ($GW$, $T$-matrix, and second-Born) as in the usual electron-hole case.

Specifically, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting $v$-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case.

The present paper investigates the possible existence of the PDR built on excited states in a neutron-rich $^{80}$Ge nucleus using the phonon damping model (PDM) with and without pairing correlation at zero and finite temperatures. The results obtained within the PDM with exact pairing (EP+PDM) reveal the appearance of two enhanced $\\gamma$-transitions $E_\\gamma = 7.25$ and 7.35 MeV at $T=0.6$ MeV, which carry the PDR nature and hence implying the possible existence of PDR built on excited states in this nucleus. These two $\\gamma$-energies nicely match with a recent experimental observation, thus indicating the crucial role of the inclusion of exact pairing solution in the precise description of low-lying $\\gamma$-transitions. The partition function-based analysis shows that this predicted PDR at $T=$ 0.6MeV is mainly contributed by the first $2^+$ excited state of the $^{80}$Ge nucleus. The isospin mixing at the nuclear surface is also observed in the investigated PDR at $T=0.6-0.7$ MeV. The primary mechanism underlying the emergence of the hot PDR is found due to the coupling of GDR phonon to non-collective particle-particle and hole-hole configurations at finite temperatures within the PDM framework, along with the shift in particle-hole excitation energies due to thermal pairing correlations"

In this paper, we develop, implement, and test two model-driven emulators based on (Petrov-)Galerkin projection using the prototypical test case of two-body scattering with the Minnesota potential and a more realistic local chiral potential. The high-fidelity scattering equations are solved with the matrix Numerov method, a reformulation of the popular Numerov recurrence relation for solving special second-order differential equations as a linear system of coupled equations. A novel error estimator based on reduced-space residuals is applied to an active learning approach (a greedy algorithm) to choosing training samples (\"snapshots\") for the emulator and contrasted with a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) approach. Both approaches allow for computationally efficient offline-online decompositions, but the greedy approach requires much fewer snapshot calculations. These developments set the groundwork for emulating scattering observables based on chiral nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions and optical models, where computational speed-ups are necessary for Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Our emulators and error estimators are widely applicable to linear systems."

This EoS is applied to derive opacities and calculate the yields of isotopes formed in r-process and s-process nucleosynthesis, with and without the influence of neutrino masses or oscillations. We look at both the lanthanide and actinide sequences using the MvdW parameters that involve the interaction strength and excluded volume effects. Our results reflect the characteristic differences found in r and s processes in the synthesis and long-term evolution of isotopes from the U, Th, and Sr chain across galactic environments. The inclusion of neutrino masses enhances the neutron-to-proton ratio, favoring heavier r-process isotopes and altering the overall galactic yields by cross section suppression. These findings offer insights into the interplay of nuclear physics and astrophysical environments, highlighting the sensitivity of nucleosynthetic pathways to EoS modifications and neutrino physics. We compare these results to metallicity profiles of similar models: the Galactic Leaky Box, the Galactic Inflow, and the Galactic Closed Box models and to the kilonova event GW170781."

The quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, combined with the in-medium similarity renormalization group (IMSRG), is employed to compute their low-lying states. This approach reasonably reproduces the coexistence of weakly and strongly deformed states at comparable energies, and allows us to track the emergence of the $N=20$ island of inversion through the continuous IMSRG evolution of the chiral Hamiltonian. Our results indicate that the ground state of $^{33}$Mg with spin-parity $3/2^-$ is predominantly a strongly deformed configuration with $K^\\pi = 3/2^-$, while the lowest $7/2^-$ state is predicted to be a shape isomer, consisting of a mixture of weakly deformed configurations with different $K$ values.

The interquark interaction in the model is reminiscent of that derived in Coulomb gauge QCD, with the string tension being the only model parameter. We demonstrate that while the confining interaction induces spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry at T=0, chiral symmetry gets restored at a temperature Tch ~ 90 MeV for the string tension fixed to provide the phenomenological value of the quark condensate. This temperature is similar to Tch ~ 130 MeV observed on the lattice in the chiral limit for N_c=3. The physical mechanism responsible for the chiral symmetry restoration in the confining regime is Pauli blocking of the quark levels, required for the existence of a nonvanishing quark condensate, by the thermal excitations of the quarks and antiquarks. Thus, above the chiral restoration temperature, the meson-like states are chirally symmetric and approximately chiral spin symmetric. A crucial property of the confined meson-like light-light states above Tch is their size that exceeds drastically that in the chirally broken phase below Tch, in contrast to the heavy-heavy mesons that nearly preserve their size irrespective of the temperature. This property is a result of Pauli blocking of the quark and antiquark levels with small momenta. Furthermore, the root-mean-square radius of the states with J=0,1 diverges in the chiral limit. This unexpected property must be a key to understanding unusual features of the hot QCD matter as observed at RHIC and LHC. Consequently, the confining but chirally symmetric matter above Tch can be considered as a dense system of very large and strongly overlapping meson-like states (``strings'')."

The critical mass for the appearance of quark matter decreases with increasing dark matter content. We introduce the concept of \"masquerading hybrid stars\", where dark matter admixed stars exhibit similar mass-radius relations to purely hadronic stars, making it challenging to distinguish between them based solely on these parameters.

However the dynamical nature of this repulsion (referred to as a nuclear core) is as elusive as ever. We present the study of nuclear dynamics at extremely large internal momenta in the deuteron dominated by the nuclear core. It is demonstrated that the paradigm shift in the description of the deuteron consisting of proton and neutron to the description of the deuteron as a pseudo-vector composite system in which proton and neutron is observed in high energy electro-disintegration processes results in the emergence of a new structure. We demonstrate that this new structure can exist only if it emerges from pre-existing non-nucleonic component in the deuteron. The study of the dynamics of the predicted new structure is presented focusing on the question if it allows to understand the anomaly observed in the recent experiment at Jefferson Lab that probed deuteron structure at internal momenta above 800 MeV/c."

The antikaon condensate is the most studied and plausible candidate among meson condensates. However, little is known about the exact interaction mechanisms between antikaons and mediator mesons. In this work, we aim to determine hadron couplings in the mesonic sector using SU(3) flavour symmetry. Among the three key parameters we calculate $\\theta_v$, the mixing angle between the octet meson $\\omega_8$ and the singlet meson $\\phi_1$; the ratio of the octet to singlet couplings $z$; and leave the weight factor that balances the symmetric and antisymmetric couplings $\\alpha_v$ as a free parameter to explore its impact on the system. Using this approach, we derive the couplings for antikaon interactions with both singlet and octet mesons in the nonet vector meson family and examine the corresponding implications for dense matter featuring antikaon condensation. Our findings reveal that the equation of state for dense matter becomes progressively stiffer with increasing values of $\\alpha_v$, which delays the onset of antikaon condensation and increases the maximum achievable mass of neutron stars. This establishes a lower bound for $\\alpha_v$ that is consistent with the observed minimum masses of pulsars."

In this framework, the machine learning algorithm is guided by the underlying physical laws, enabling the accurate extraction of the inverse scattering potential from the elastic scattering data. Methodology: As a reference potential, a combination of three smoothly joined Morse functions has been utilized, characterized by ten model parameters. These parameters are optimized in an iterative fashion using a Genetic Algorithm to ensure the best fit to the phase shifts extracted from the experimental scattering data. The process of optimization is guided by the computed scattering phase shifts by solving the phase equation using 5th order RK-method for the reference potential in each iteration Results: Our approach yields inverse potentials for both single and multi channel scattering. Using the Scattering Phase Shifts obtained from these inverse potentials, we calculate the partial cross-section to determine the resonance energies and decay width. The obtain values of resonance energies and decay width for 3D1, 3D2 and 3D3 states of alpha-deuteron are in correspondence with the experimental results. Conclusion: It can be concluded that our machine learning-based approach for constructing the inverse potential offers a novel and complementary technique to existing direct methods."

The $D_3$-$D_7$ brane configuration and the RMF model lead to an equation of state that is used to solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations. For different model parameters, the mass-radius diagram is presented. The conditions for the dynamic stability of stellar configurations are discussed, considering the radial oscillation criterion for hybrid stars with slow phase transitions. Strikingly, it is shown that the models generate stable star configurations with a core of quarks. We compare our results with NICER observational data for the pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620 and show that the compact stars generated from this method fall within the corresponding observational regions."

This formalism is applied to the QCD thermodynamics described by a 2+1 flavor low energy effective field theory within the functional renormalization group approach. It is found that the temperature fluctuations are suppressed remarkably as the matter is evolved from the phase of hadron resonance gas to the quark-gluon plasma phase with increasing temperature or baryon chemical potential, which is attributed to the significant increase of the heat capacity of matter. Furthermore, the same mechanism leads to a negative skewness in the temperature fluctuations."

A variety of ab initio methods are now available for computing the properties of nuclei from interactions rooted in Quantum Chromodynamics, but applications have largely been limited to zero temperature. In the present work, we extend one such method, the In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group (IMSRG), to finite temperature. Using an exactly-solvable schematic model that captures essential features of nuclear interactions, we show that the FT-IMSRG can accurately determine the energetics of nuclei at finite temperature, and we explore the accuracy of the FT-IMSRG in different parameter regimes, e.g., strong and weak pairing. In anticipation of FT-IMSRG applications for finite nuclei and infinite matter, we discuss differences arising from the choice of working with the canonical and the grand canonical ensembles. In future work, we will apply the FT-IMSRG with realistic nuclear interactions to compute nuclear structure and reaction properties at finite temperature, which are important ingredients for understanding nucleosynthesis in stellar environments, or modeling reactions of hot compound nuclei."

Its gravitational quadrupole moment can then be deduced using solar models, or through helioseismology, and it can also be determined from measurements of its gravitational effects on Mercury's orbit. The various assessments do not appear to agree, with the most complete and precise orbital assessments being in slight excess of other determinations. This may speak to the existence of a non-luminous disk or ring, where we also note evidence for a circumsolar dust ring within Mercury's orbit from the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission. Historically, too, a protoplanetary disk may have been key to reconciling the Sun's metallicity with its neutrino yield. The distribution of the non-luminous mass within Mercury's orbit can modify the relative size of the optical and orbital quadrupole moments in different ways. We develop how we can use these findings to limit the mass of a dark disk, ring, or halo in the immediate vicinity of the Sun, and we note how future observational studies of the inner solar system can not only refine these constraints but also help to identify and to assess the mass of its dark-matter component."

These models reduce to Israel-Stewart theory for small values of the viscous stress $\\Pi$. However, when $\\Pi$ becomes comparable to the equilibrium pressure $P$, the evolution equations \"adjust\" to prevent the onset of far-from-equilibrium pathologies that would otherwise plague Israel-Stewart. Specifically, the equations of motion remain symmetric hyperbolic and causal at all times along any continuously differentiable flow, and across the whole thermodynamic state space. This means that, no matter how fast the fluid expands or contracts, the hydrodynamic equations are always well-behaved (away from singularities). The second law of thermodynamics is enforced exactly. Near equilibrium, these models can accommodate an arbitrarily complicated dependence of the bulk viscosity coefficient $\\zeta$ on both density and temperature."

Within the energy range where DUNE’s maximum flux appears, the steering value for DUNE shows a 21% deviation from the standard model (SM) to NSI for normal ordering (NO), while for inverted ordering (IO), the steering value increases by approximately 15% relative to the SM.

In the first realistic application, a large basis of 25 TDDFT trajectories is employed to calculate the charge yields and total kinetic energy distribution for the fission of $^{240}$Pu. The results are compared with available data, and with those obtained using a standard TDDFT, that does not consider quantum fluctuations, and the adiabatic TDGCM+GOA (Gaussian overlap approximation). It is shown that fragment yields and kinetic energies can simultaneously be described in a consistent microscopic framework that includes fluctuations in the collective degrees of freedom and the one-body dissipation mechanism."

With the obtained light-front wavefunction of the evolved state, we extract the quark jet transverse momentum broadening, the quenching parameter, the cross section, the gluon emission rate, and the evolution of the invariant mass. The scenario considered is relevant for high energy scattering processes, where the quark originates from far outside the color field describing the scattering target. This investigation on dressed quarks complements our earlier studies of the single quark scattering in the $\\ket{q}$ Fock space, and of the bare quark scattering in the $\\ket{q}+\\ket{qg}$ Fock space, providing a novel systematic description of quark scattering process using a non-perturbative formalism."

Tidal heating during the merger of neutron stars composed of nuclear matter may be considered negligible, but it has been demonstrated recently that the presence of hyperons at high densities could significantly enhance the dissipation during inspiral. In this work, we evaluate the bulk viscosity arising from non-leptonic weak processes involving quarks and show that it can be several orders of magnitude higher than the viscosity of nuclear matter at temperatures relevant to the inspiral phase of the merger of strange stars. We model strange quark matter in the normal phase using a non-ideal bag model including electrons and ensure compatibility with astrophysical constraints. By analysing equal-mass binary systems with component masses ranging from 1.4 to 1.8 $\\, M_{\\odot}$, we find that temperatures close to 0.1 MeV are reached by the end of the inspiral phase. We also estimate the effect on the gravitational waveform and conclude that the additional phase shift could range from $0.1$ to $0.5$ radians for strange quark masses of 200 MeV, making it potentially detectable by next-generation gravitational wave detectors. Given that tidal heating from hyperons is dominant only for very massive neutron stars having masses 1.8 to 2.0 $\\, M_{\\odot}$, a successful detection of this phase shift during the inspiral of binary systems with relatively low masses of 1.4 to 1.6 $\\, M_{\\odot}$ could be a smoking gun signature for the existence of strange quark stars."

With this in mind, we explore the implementation of three-parameter finite-temperature matter models in the computation of neutron-star oscillations. We consider in detail the thermodynamics of nuclear matter and show how this information enters the problem. Our realistic treatment takes into account entropy and composition gradients that exist in the nuclear matter, giving rise to buoyant g-mode oscillations. To illustrate the implementation, we determine the oscillation spectrum of a low-temperature neutron star. In addition to the expected compositional and thermal g-modes, we find perturbations sourced by phase transitions in the equation of state. We also examine two thermal models, comparing the results for constant redshifted temperature with those for uniform entropy per baryon."

The existence of the $DDD^*$ bound state remains uncertain due to significant variations in the OBE interaction, particularly in the strength of scalar-meson-exchange interactions, which can differ by a factor about 20 between two commonly used OBE models. This discrepancy renders the $DDD^*$ system highly model-dependent. To address this issue, we constrain the scalar-meson-exchange interaction using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position, where the pseudoscalar-meson coupling is well-determined, and the $\\rho$- and $\\omega$-exchange interactions nearly cancel each other out, leaving the coupling constant of the $\\sigma$-exchange as the only unknown parameter. Our results indicate that the isospin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ $DDD^*$ bound states exist when $Z_c(3900)$ is a virtual state of $D\\bar{D}^*/\\bar{D}D^*$ located within approximately $-15$ MeV of the threshold. However, the three-body bound state is gone when the $Z_c(3900)$ virtual state pole is more than $20$ MeV away from the threshold. Each experimental progress, either on the $DDD^*$ state or the $Z_c(3900)$, can shed light on the nature of the other state. Another significant outcome is a refined set of OBE model parameters calibrated using the pole positions of $X(3872)$, $T_{cc}(3875)$, and $Z_c(3900)$, rigorously addressing the cutoff dependence. These parameters provide a valuable resource for more accurate calculations of systems involving few-body $D$, $D^*$ and their antiparticles. Additionally, we find no evidence of the $DDD^*$ three-body resonances after extensive search using a combination of the Gaussian expansion method and the complex scaling method."

However, certain observational constraints on the structural properties of compact stars help us constrain the EoS to a fair extent. Moreover, gravitational asteroseismology gives a notion of the composition and EoS of compact stars. The next generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors are likely to detect several oscillation mode frequencies of the GWs. In this work we compute the fundamental ($f$) and the first pressure ($p_1$) mode frequencies ($f_f$ and $f_{p1}$, respectively) with different compositions viz., hadronic, quark, and hybrid star (HS) matter. For HSs, we also study the gravity ($g$) mode frequency ($f_g$). For each phase we also study the correlation between the oscillation frequencies of 1.4 $M_{\\odot}$ and 2.01 $M_{\\odot}$ compact stars with other different properties. We find that various possible composition of compact stars substantially affects the oscillation frequencies. However, the mass-scaled angular $f$ mode frequency ($\\omega_f M$) varies universally with compactness ($C$) for all hadronic, quark and hybrid stars. The $f$ mode frequency ($f_{f_{1.4}}$) of the canonical 1.4 $M_{\\odot}$ compact star, obtained with different composition, is quite correlated with the canonical radius ($R_{1.4}$) and tidal deformability ($\\Lambda_{1.4}$) while $f_{p_{1.4}}$ is well correlated with slope parameter of the symmetry energy. We also show that $f_{g_{1.4}}$ of the HSs varies almost linearly with $\\Lambda_{1.4}$. Should $g$ modes be detected, they could not only support the existence of HSs, but $f_g$ could be useful to understand the strength of quark repulsion in HSs."

      "summary": "arXiv:2504.08631v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In the last decades, femtoscopic measurements from heavy-ion collisions have become a popular tool to investigate the strong interactions between hadrons. The key observables measured in such experiments are the two-hadron momentum correlations, which depend on the production mechanism of hadron pairs and the final-state interactions. Given the complexity of ultra-relativistic collision experiments, the source term describing the production mechanism can only be modeled phenomenologically based on numerous assumptions. The commonly employed approach for analyzing femtoscopic data relies on the Koonin-Pratt formula, which relates the measured correlation functions with the relative wave function of an outgoing hadron pair and a source term that is assumed to be universal. Here, we critically examine this universality assumption and show that for strongly interacting particles such as nucleons, the interpretation of femtoscopic measurements suffers from a potentially large intrinsic uncertainty. We also comment on the ongoing efforts to explore three-body interactions using this experimental technique."

To this end, we derive a multipole decomposition of 2BCs to fully include the momentum-transfer dependence in ${\\it ab\\,\\,initio}$ calculations. As application, we investigate the effects of 2BCs on the strong M1 transition at 10.23 MeV in $^{48}$Ca using the valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group (VS-IMSRG) with a set of non-implausible interactions as well as the 1.8/2.0 (EM) interaction. Experiments, such as $(e,e')$ and $(\\gamma,n)$, disagree on the magnetic dipole strength $B$(M1) for this transition. Our VS-IMSRG results favor larger $B$(M1) values similar to recent coupled-cluster calculations. However, for this transition there are larger cancellations between the leading pion-in-flight and seagull 2BCs, so that future calculations including higher-order 2BCs are important. For validation of our results, we investigate additional observables in $^{48}$Ca as well as M1 transitions in $^{48}$Ti. For these, our results agree with experiment. Finally, our results show that for medium-mass nuclei 2BC contributions to M1 and Gamow-Teller transitions are, as expected, very different. Therefore, using similar quenching factors for both in phenomenological calculations is not supported from first principles."

Two different DF sets are used: that calculated using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector $\\times$ vector contact interaction (SCI) and the other expressing results obtained using continuum Schwinger function methods (CSMs). Thus determined, the EFFs serve as driving terms in a coupled set of hadron cascade equations, whose solution yields the complete array of hadron-scale fragmentation functions (FFs) for pion and kaon production in high energy reactions. After evolution to scales typical of experiments, the SCI and CSM FF predictions are seen to be in semiquantitative agreement. Importantly, they conform with a range of physical expectations for FF behaviour on the endpoint domains $z\\simeq 0, 1$, e.g., nonsinglet FFs vanish at $z=0$ and singlet FFs diverge faster than $1/z$. Predictions for hadron multiplicities in jets are also delivered. They reveal SU$(3)$ symmetry breaking in the charged-kaon/neutral-kaon multiplicity ratio, whose size diminishes with increasing reaction energy, and show that, with increasing energy, the pion/kaon ratio in $e^+ e^- \\to h X$ diminishes to a value that is independent of hadron masses."

In a sufficiently large magnetic field the ground state is either a chiral soliton lattice (CSL), an array of solitons of the neutral pion field, or a domain-wall Skyrmion phase in which Skyrmions emerge inside the chiral solitons. In the region of large chemical potential and a magnetic field lower than its critical value for CSL, a Skyrmion crystal is expected to take up the ground state based on the chiral perturbation theory at the next leading order. We determine the phase boundary between such a Skyrmion crystal and the QCD vacuum. There was a conjecture that a magnetic field deforms the Skyrmion into a pancake shape whose boundary is a superconducting ring of charged pions. In contrast, through the exact Skyrmion solution, we find that the pancake conjecture holds approximately in a strong magnetic field, but fails for a weak one. We also validate that a Skyrmion would shrink to null without the Skyrme term, although Derrick's scaling law is modified by a background magnetic field, and the stability at the leading order is not ruled out in theory."

By varying the value of $\\Gamma_{\\rm th}$ within the hybrid EOS framework, we investigate the thermal effects on the merger dynamics, gravitational waves (GWs), and the dynamical mass ejection process. We find that the choice of the constant $\\Gamma_{\\rm th}$ can change the outcome of the remnant for specific EOSs and $m_0$. We also show that the dynamical ejecta mass is affected by the $\\Gamma_{\\rm th}$ value in a different way for different EOSs: for a stiff EOS the ejecta mass is high when $\\Gamma_{\\rm th}$ is small, while for softer EOSs the largest ejecta is achieved when $\\Gamma_{\\rm th} = 1.3$--$1.4$. While the inspiral motion does not depend on the $\\Gamma_{\\rm th}$, the post merger phase evolution is highly affected by that. We show that the dominant peak frequency $f_2$ of the post merger GW spectrum monotonically decreases as the $\\Gamma_{\\rm th}$ increases. We find that the universal relations between NS macroscopic properties and post-merger GW frequencies are subject to non-negligible thermal uncertainties, which can obscure the universal relation between the tidal deformability and $f_2$."

In widely used equation of state (EoS) meta-models, such as the Polytrope (PP) and Speed-of-Sound (CS) models, this first-order phase transition behavior can be naturally mimicked by tuning some model parameters. Here, we systematically explore the under-explored parameter space within one of a widely adopted CS model that leads to twin stars via a strong first-order phase transition. Within this twin-star subspace, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis that integrates mass--radius (MR) constraints from X-ray observations of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. The resultant twin star branch, situated within the 1--1.2 $M_{\\odot}$ mass range and approximately 7 km in radius, surprisingly coincides with the MR ranges proposed for the recent anomaly in the Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsars XTE J1814--338 (J1814), suggesting a hybrid twin star configuration. Moreover, incorporating the J1814 observation as an additional constraint yields an extreme phase transition pressure $P_{\\text{trans}} = 108.9_{-4.85}^{+6.46}$ MeV/fm$^3$, a transition density of $\\varepsilon_{\\text{trans}}/\\varepsilon_0 = 4.847_{-0.134}^{+0.271}$(where $\\varepsilon_0$ is the nuclear saturation energy density) and an energy density jump $\\Delta \\varepsilon = 558.7_{-278.7}^{+303.6}$ MeV/fm$^3$, corresponding to $\\Delta \\varepsilon/\\varepsilon_0 = 3.716_{-1.854}^{+2.020}$. Notably, to satisfy all astrophysical constraints, the speed of sound inside of the hybrid twin star core is driven toward the speed of light ($c_s^2/c^2 > 0.9$), indicating the potential presence of strongly interacting, exotic matter in this core region."

Based on the self-consistent mean-field calculations with a given energy density functional and a pairing interaction, the IBM Hamiltonian for even-even nuclei, single-particle energies, and occupation probabilities for unpaired nucleons, which are necessary building blocks of the IBFFM Hamiltonian and Gamow-Teller and Fermi transition operators, are completely determined. A few coupling constants of the boson-fermion and residual neutron-proton interactions are only phenomenological parameters fitted to reproduce low-energy spectra of odd-mass and odd-odd nuclei. It is found that the calculated $\\log{}_{10}ft$ values for the $\\beta^+$ decays $^{68}$As$\\to^{68}$Ge are particularly sensitive to the quadrupole-quadrupole boson interaction strength used for the parent ($^{68}$As) nucleus.

We demonstrate our approach on a 2-feature model of nuclear binding energies per nucleon with proton and neutron number pairs as inputs. We show that {\\Delta}-UQ can produce reliable and self-consistent epistemic uncertainty estimates and can be used to assess the degree of confidence in predictions made with deep neural networks."

While the emergence of magic numbers beyond 20 is commonly attributed to strong spin-orbit coupling, the microscopic origin of the spin-orbit potential remains elusive, owing to its dependence on the resolution scale and renormalization scheme of nuclear forces. Here, we investigate the evolution of shell structure with varying momentum resolution in nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory, using the similarity renormalization group, which provides a fundamental framework for linking different scales. We uncover a universal transition from spin symmetry to pseudospin symmetry as the resolution scale decreases, during which magic numbers emerge naturally. A similar pattern is found in calculations using relativistic one-boson-exchange potentials, underscoring the robustness of the phenomenon. This work establishes a direct connection between realistic nuclear forces with a high resolution scale and effective nuclear forces at coarse-grained scales, offering a first-principles explanation for the origin of magic numbers and pseudospin symmetry in nuclear shell structure, and new insights into the structure of exotic nuclei far from stability."

Previous simulation studies suggest that lepton capture (LC) rates on isotopes of vanadium have a substantial effect in regulating the electron fraction (Ye) during the final evolutionary phases. The present work involves the calculation of LC rates for 22 isotopes of vanadium using the proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA) model. The considered mass range is from A = 43 to 64. The LC rates are computed over stellar densities ranging from 10^1 to 10^11 g/cm^3 and temperatures in the range 10^7 to 3 x 10^10 K. A comparison of our LC rates with those obtained using other models (IPM and LSSM) is also presented. Compared to other models, the pn-QRPA rates at high temperature (3 x 10^10 K) are larger by 1-2 orders of magnitude."

The relative abundance, coupled with the stellar weak rates on Mo isotopes, may change the lepton-to-baryon content of the core material. Here, we report on the calculation of nuclear structure properties of Mo isotopes from mass number 82 to 138, employing the RMF model.

In the first step, the ground-state nuclear properties of Mo isotopes such as binding energy per nucleon, neutron and proton separation energies, charge radii, total electric quadrupole moments, and the deformation parameter of electric quadrupole moments have been calculated using the density-dependent version of the RMF model with DD-PC1 and DD-ME2 functionals. The calculated electric quadrupole deformation parameters have been used in a deformed pn-QRPA calculation in the second phase of this work to calculate half-lives and weak decay rates for these Mo isotopes in stellar matter.

In particular, assuming a spherical Wigner-Seitz cell, the clusters are fixed by solving the Dirac equations imposing the Dirichlet-Neumann boundary condition, while the nuclear medium are treated with Thomas-Fermi approximation and take constant densities. In the presence of nuclear medium, the clusters eventually become unbound as density increases, while the root-mean-square charge radii increase. For clusters with different proton and neutron numbers $N_p \\neq N_n$, their binding energies varies with the proton fraction of nuclear medium, which are less significant for clusters with $N_p = N_n$. The uncertainties of density functionals on the clustering phenomenon are investigated as well adopting 8 different functionals. Based on the obtained results, an analytical formula describing the binding energies of in-medium clusters is then obtained. The results presented in this work should be useful to understand the clustering phenomenon in both heavy-ion collisions and neutron stars."

The purpose of this work is to investigate deep-inelastic collisions of 144Sm+144Sm and 154Sm+154Sm with microscopic mean-field approaches and to show a predominant role of one-body dissipation as well as one-body fluctuations and correlation in low-energy heavy-ion reactions.

Backward time evolutions are performed as well to evaluate fluctuations and correlation in nucleon numbers within time-dependent random phase approximation (TDRPA). With TDRPA we calculate mass- and charge-number fluctuations, as well as the correlation between neutron and proton transfers, for each impact parameter. We demonstrate that TDRPA quantitatively reproduces the experimental \\sigma_{AA}^2-TKEL distributions, whereas it systematically underestimates the charge fluctuation, \\sigma_{ZZ}. The double-differential cross sections of reaction products are calculated, showing good agreement with the experimental data.

In the noncentral events of heavy-ion collisions, the produced medium can carry a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity. This rotation can significantly affect various properties, including viscous properties and the expansion of the QGP medium. Using a novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation at finite angular velocity, we have calculated the shear and bulk viscosities and compared them with their counterparts in the standard relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach. Our results show that the angular velocity increases both shear and bulk viscosities, suggesting an enhanced momentum transfer within the medium and greater fluctuations in local pressure. This rotational effect on viscosities is more evident at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. Our analysis also shows that, compared to the standard relaxation time approximation, the shear viscosity is lower while the bulk viscosity is higher in the novel relaxation time approximation for all temperatures. Additionally, some observables related to the flow characteristic, fluid behavior and conformal symmetry of the medium are markedly impacted due to rotation. We have also studied the hydrodynamic evolution of matter within the Bjorken boost-invariant scenario and have found that the energy density evolves faster in the presence of finite rotation than in the nonrotating case. Consequently, rapid rotation accelerates the cooling process of the QGP medium."

At the advent of QCD, an alternative hypothesis emerged suggesting, at high energies, the transport of a nucleon's baryon number could be traced by a non-perturbative configuration of gluon fields connecting its three valence quarks, forming a $Y$-shaped topology known as the gluon junction. Recent measurements by the STAR experiment are compatible with this scenario. In light of these measurements, this study aims to explore the mechanisms of baryon transport in high-energy nuclear collisions using the PYTHIA-8 framework, which incorporates a state-of-the-art hadronization model with advanced Color Flow (CF) and Color Reconnection (CR) mechanisms which mimic signatures of a baryon junction. Within this model setup, we investigate (i) the rapidity slope of the net-baryon distributions in photon-included processes ($\\gamma$+p) and (ii) baryon over charge transport in the isobaric (Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr) collisions. Our study highlights the importance of the CF and CR mechanisms in PYTHIA-8, which plays a crucial role in baryon transport.

This channel offers a promising avenue for benchmarking the still largely unconstrained odderon amplitude."

They are universal and process-independent. As a matter of fact, nucleon PDFs are inevitably affected by nuclear matter during nuclear scattering process. In order to study the nuclear PDFs (nPDFs), in this paper, we introduce the nucleon pair PDFs (dPDFs) to describe parton distributions in the nucleon pair which is confined to a nucleus. We first of all construct the nuclear state in terms of the nucleonic states and calculate the operator definition of nPDFs. Neglecting the higher order corrections or multi-nucleon correlations, we find that nPDFs can be written as a sum of two terms which respectively correspond to PDFs and dPDFs. Nucleon pair PDFs which stem from nucleon-nucleon correlation are proportional to common nucleon PDFs but suppressed by a factor. Compared with the experimental data, we find that dPDFs can explain the behaviour of the EMC effect. We further calculate the Paschos-Wolfenstein ratio to study the nuclear matter effect on the extraction of weak mixing angle or $\\sin^2\\theta_W$ by using dPDFs."

In the limit of extremely high beam energies and small energy transfers, very transparent equations emerge. We apply these equations to analyze nuclear fragmentation in UPCs at the LHC and $eA$ scattering at the EIC, demonstrating that the EIC could facilitate unique photonuclear physics studies. However, we have also shown that the fragmentation cross-sections at the EIC are about 1,000 times smaller than those at the LHC. At the LHC, the fragmentation of uranium nuclei displays characteristic double-hump mass distributions from fission events, while at the EIC, fragmentation is dominated by neutron emission and fewer few fission products, about 10,000 smaller number of events."

The effective chiral Lagrangian for kaon-baryon and kaon-kaon interactions is utilized within chiral symmetry approach in combination with the interaction model between baryons. For the baryon-baryon interactions, we adopt the minimal relativistic mean-field theory with exchange of scalar mesons and vector mesons between baryons without including the nonlinear self-interacting meson field terms. In addition, the universal three-baryon repulsion and the phenomenological three-nucleon attraction are introduced as density-dependent effective two-body potentials. The repulsive effects leading to stiff equation of state at high densities consist of both the two-baryon repulsion via the vector-meson exchange and the universal three-baryon repulsion. Interplay of kaon condensates with hyperons through chiral dynamics in dense matter is clarified, and resulting onset mechanisms of kaon condensation in hyperon-mixed matter and the equation of state with the ($Y$+$K$) phase and characteristic features of the system are presented. It is shown that the slope $L$ of the symmetry energy controls the two-baryon repulsion beyond the saturation density and resulting stiffness of the equation of state. The stiffness of the equation of state in turn controls admixture of hyperons and the onset and development of kaon condensates as a result of competing effect between kaon condensates and hyperons. The equation of state with the ($Y$+$K$) phase becomes stiff enough to be consistent with recent observations of massive neutron stars. Static properties of neutron stars with the ($Y$+$K$) phase are discussed."

Our method is developed from the strong correlations that are shown to exist between the neutron star mass-radius curve and the equation of state (EOS) or pressure-energy density relation. Selecting points that have masses equal to fixed fractions of the maximum mass, we find a semi-universal power-law relation between the central energy densities, pressures, sound speeds, chemical potentials and number densities of those stars, with the maximum mass and the radii of one or more fractional maximum mass points. Root-mean-square fitting accuracies, for EOSs without large first-order phase transitions, are typically 0.5% for all quantities at all mass points. The method also works well, although less accurately, in reconstructing the EOS of hybrid stars with first-order phase transitions. These results permit, in effect, an analytic method of inverting an arbitrary mass-radius curve to yield its underlying EOS. We discuss applications of this inversion technique to the inference of the dense matter EOS from measurements of neutron star masses and radii as a possible alternative to traditional Bayesian approaches."

Our analysis reveals that the leading perturbative correction introduces a factor $4/3$, which, along with subsequent corrections, indicates that the effective electromagnetic mass deviates from the conventional relation $E/c^2$. This discrepancy is attributed to the intrinsic nonlocality of the electromagnetic field, rather than to additional compensating mechanisms such as Poincar\\'e stresses. We further contrast our quantum field theory results with the highly accurate predictions of the Schr\\\"odinger equation, which, despite neglecting higher-order terms, achieves an average error on the order of $10^{-5}\\%$. Attempts to improve this accuracy via perturbative inclusion of the self-interaction of the electron's wave function instead increase the error, prompting a re-examination of the underlying perturbative assumptions. Our findings suggest that a non-perturbative treatment of the tree-level action may be required to fully capture the dynamics of bound states in quantum field theory."

This paper provides a rationale for the fact that both right-handed and left-handed antineutrinos are produced in beta decays of nuclei. But the conversion procedure in any case assigns a right-handed antineutrino to each electron, which leads to the superiority of the theoretical rate of inverse beta decays over the experimental one. The right-handed antineutrino is produced in the mode of beta decay of the nucleus due to the standard electroweak interaction. The left-handed antineutrino appears in the mode caused by the existence of a interaction, the carrier of which is a massless pseudoscalar boson having a Yukawa coupling with the electron neutrino and nucleons. The emission of such a boson from a virtual right-handed antineutrino converts it into a free left-handed antineutrino."

We find that FFC can be significantly affected as the spatial variation rate of $\\lambda$ increases, and strong spatial variations can completely stabilize initially unstable systems. Using stability analysis based solely on initial conditions, we identified for the first time a critical variation rate above which no FFC occurs even if the flavor instability exists. By analyzing several representative matter profiles based on an 18 $M_{\\odot}$ SN model, we show that spatially inhomogeneous $\\lambda$ can suppress the occurrence of FFC associated with shallow ELN zero crossings in most of the SN's radial region, especially during the accretion phase. Our finding highlights the need to consider the impact of matter inhomogeneity in the development of improved SN models that aim to include the effect of neutrino flavor conversions."

These processes are studied for energies of the incident beams in the range 18-30 MeV, in order to have a sufficient energy to produce such a boson, whose mass is estimated to be around 17 MeV. We first analyze them as a purely electromagnetic processes, in the context of a state-of-the-art approach to nuclear strong-interaction dynamics and nuclear electromagnetic currents, derived from chiral effective field theory chiEFT. Next, we examine how the exchange of a hypothetical low-mass boson would impact the cross sections for such processes. We consider several possibilities, that this boson is either a scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, or axial particle. The main aim of the study is to exploit the specular structure of the 3He and 3H nuclei to investigate the isospin dependency of the X17-nucleon interaction, as the alleged \"proto-phobicity\"."

A major source of uncertainty comes from the detailed modeling of the initial state. While the collision itself likely involves far-from-equilibrium dynamics, it is not excluded that a fluid theory of second order can reasonably well describe its soft features. Here we explore this possibility and discuss how the state before the collision can be described in that setup, what are the requirements from relativistic causality to the form of the equations of motion, how much entropy production can result from shear and bulk viscous dissipation during the initial longitudinal dynamics, and how one can thus obtain sensible initial conditions for the subsequent transverse expansion. While we do here only first steps, we outline a larger program. If the latter could be successfully completed it could lead to a dynamical description of heavy-ion collisions where the only uncertainty lies in the thermodynamic and transport properties of quantum chromodynamics."

To constrain the EOS across its entire density range, this information needs to be combined consistently. However, the impact and model-dependency of individual observations vary. We present a broad compendium of different constraints and apply them individually to a large set of EOS candidates within a Bayesian framework. Specifically, we explore different ways how chiral effective field theory and perturbative quantum chromodynamics can be used to place a likelihood on EOS candidates. We also investigate the impact of nuclear experimental constraints, as well as different radio and X-ray observations of neutron star (NS) masses and radii. This is augmented by reanalyses of the existing data from BNS coalescences, in particular of GW170817, with improved models for the tidal waveform and kilonova light curves, which we also utilize to construct a tight upper limit of 2.39$\\,$M$_\\odot$ on the TOV mass based on GW170817's remnant. Our diverse set of constraints is eventually combined to obtain stringent limits on NS properties. We organize the combination in a way to distinguish between constraints where the systematic uncertainties are deemed small and those that rely on less conservative assumptions. For the former, we find the radius of the canonical 1.4$\\,$M$_\\odot$ neutron star to be $R_{1.4}= 12.26_{-0.91}^{+0.80}\\,$km and the TOV mass at $M_{\\rm TOV}= 2.25_{-0.22}^{+0.42}\\,$M$_\\odot$ (95% credibility).

Unraveling the theoretical origin of confinement continues to be a profound and longstanding challenge in both physics and mathematics. Motivated by recent advances in quantum Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, we investigate the Wilson loop expectation values in the large-$N$ limit of $\\mathscr{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory at finite chemical potential, employing a holographic approach within the background of an extremal AdS$_5$ Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black brane. Our results reveal that quantum gravitational fluctuations in the near-horizon region significantly modify the holographic Wilson loop expectation values. These values exhibit an area-law behavior, indicative of a confining quark-antiquark potential. Within this framework, our findings suggest that confinement in the super-Yang-Mills theory arises as a consequence of near-horizon quantum gravity fluctuations in the bulk extremal AdS$_5$ black brane geometry."

We report closed-form expressions of the reduced kinetic and exchange energies of these excited-state UEGs as functions of the density and the gap. Additionally, we derive the leading term of the correlation energy in the high-density limit. By incorporating an additional variable representing the degree of excitation into the UEG paradigm, the present work introduces a new framework for constructing local and semi-local state-specific functionals for excited states."

It is shown that such a combination has the advantages of both these approaches, namely, the number of the fitting parameters remains relatively small (as for the $R$-matrix approach) and the proper analytic structure of the $S$-matrix is preserved (as for the Jost function method). It is also shown that the new formalism, although closely related to the $R$-matrix method, has the benefit of no dependence on an arbitrary channel radius. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are tested using a model single-channel potential.

      "summary": "arXiv:2504.11685v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The many-body nature of nuclear physics problems poses significant computational challenges. These challenges become even more pronounced when studying the resonance states of nuclear systems, which are governed by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Quantum computing, particularly for quantum many-body systems, offers a promising alternative, especially within the constraints of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work aims to simulate nuclear resonances using quantum algorithms by developing a variational framework compatible with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and implementing it fully on a quantum simulator. We employ the complex scaling technique to extract resonance positions classically and adapt it for quantum simulations using a two-step algorithm. First, we transform the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian into a Hermitian form by using the energy variance as a cost function within a variational framework. Second, we perform theta-trajectory calculations to determine optimal resonance positions in the complex energy plane. To address resource constraints on NISQ devices, we utilize Gray Code (GC) encoding to reduce qubit requirements. We first validate our approach using a schematic potential model that mimics a nuclear potential, successfully reproducing known resonance energies with high fidelity. We then extend the method to a more realistic alpha-alpha nuclear potential and compute the resonance energies with a basis size of 16, using only four qubits. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that the complete theta-trajectory method can be implemented on a quantum computer without relying on any classical input beyond the Hamiltonian. The results establish a scalable and efficient quantum framework for simulating resonance phenomena in nuclear systems. This work represents a significant step toward quantum simulations of open quantum systems."

The nuclear shell-model calculations providing deeper insights into the properties of atomic nuclei, is one such case with high demand for resources as the size of the Hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of particles involved. Quantum algorithms are being developed to overcome these challenges and advance such calculations. To develop quantum circuits for the nuclear shell-model, leveraging the capabilities of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We aim to minimize resource requirements (specifically in terms of qubits and gates) and strive to reduce the impact of noise by employing relevant mitigation techniques. We achieve noise resilience by designing an optimized ansatz for the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based on Givens rotations and incorporating qubit-ADAPT-VQE in combination with variational quantum deflation (VQD) to compute ground and excited states incorporating the zero-noise extrapolation mitigation technique. Furthermore, the qubit requirements are significantly reduced by mapping the basis states to qubits using Gray code encoding and generalizing transformations of fermionic operators to efficiently represent manybody states. By employing the noise-resilient protocols, we achieve the ground and excited state energy levels of 38Ar and 6Li with better accuracy. These energy levels are presented for noiseless simulations, noisy conditions, and after applying noise mitigation techniques. Results are compared for Jordan Wigner and Gray code encoding using VQE, qubit-ADAPT-VQE, and VQD. Our work highlights the potential of noise-resilient protocols to leverage the full potential of NISQ devices in scaling the nuclear shell model calculations."

In this regime, the relaxation rate of weak interactions becomes comparable to the characteristic frequencies of composition g-modes in the core, resulting in resonant damping. To capture this effect, we introduce the dynamic sound speed, a complex, frequency-dependent generalization of the adiabatic sound speed that encodes both the restoring force and the dissipative effects of bulk compression. Using realistic weak reaction rates and three representative equations of state, we compute the complex frequencies of composition g-modes with finite-temperature profiles. We find that bulk viscous damping becomes increasingly significant with temperature and can completely suppress composition g-modes. In contrast, the f-mode remains largely unaffected by bulk viscosity due to its nearly divergence-free character. Our results highlight the sensitivity of g-mode behavior to thermal structure, weak reaction rates, and the equation of state, and establish the dynamic sound speed as a valuable descriptor characterizing oscillation properties in dissipative neutron star matter."

The $p$+$p$ baseline is provided by the Pythia8 event generator. The in-medium jet propagation is simulated by the linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model, which considers both the elastic and inelastic jet-medium interactions. Our theoretical results calculated by the LBT model show that the $\\Delta R_{{\\rm axis}}^{{\\rm WTA-Std}}$ distribution in Pb+Pb at $\\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV is narrower than that in $p$+$p$, which agrees well with the recent ALICE measurements. The narrowing of $\\Delta R_{{\\rm axis}}^{{\\rm WTA-Std}}$ seems to violate the $p_T$-broadening nature of the jet quenching effect, usually explained by the influence of \"selection bias\". However, the physical details still need to be fully understood. Utilizing a matching-jet method to track the jet evolution in the QGP to remove the selection bias in the Monte Carlo simulations, we observe that the $\\Delta R_{{\\rm axis}}^{{\\rm WTA-Std}}$ distribution becomes broader due to the jet-medium interactions. At the same time, by rescaling the quark/gluon-jet fractions in Pb+Pb collisions to be the same as that in $p$+$p$, we find that the fraction change may not significantly influence the modification pattern of jet $\\Delta R_{{\\rm axis}}^{{\\rm WTA-Std}}$. On the other hand, the selected jet sample in A+A collisions has a significantly narrower initial $\\Delta R_{{\\rm axis}}^{{\\rm WTA-Std}}$ distribution than the $p$+$p$ baseline, and such a biased comparison between $p$+$p$ and A+A conceals the actual jet-broadening effect in the experimental measurements. The investigations presented in this paper will deepen our understanding of the relationship between the actual intra-jet modifications in the QGP and the experimental observations."

We show that the Planck transformations align with the core principles of both Hamiltonian and Lagrangian mechanics, whereas the Ott transformations deviate from the foundational principles of Hamiltonian mechanics. These findings are supported by analysis of an ultrarelativistic ideal gas of quarks and gluons in the Stefan-Boltzmann limit. Additionally, we develop Boltzmann-Gibbs and Tsallis blast-wave models for finite-volume systems. By comparing local equilibrium transverse momentum distributions of hadrons -- derived from these models using the Planck and Ott transformations -- with global equilibrium distributions from Boltzmann-Gibbs and Tsallis formalisms, using identical parameters in the laboratory reference frame, we find that only the Planck transformations yield accurate results, while the Ott transformations produce significant discrepancies."

The first new feature is the appearance, in the deep inner crust, of an extensive and almost pure $^{14}$He layer that extends up to the density of the transition to homogeneous matter. This layer may challenge the idea of nuclear pasta phases, significantly impact the transport properties and the crust crystallization process. Second, we raise the question of the (in)stability of the inner crust with respect to diffusion of ions (buoyancy) and demonstrate that our crust is stable, in contrast with the predictions of some other models. Finally, we show that subsaturated stellar matter is thermodynamically stable with respect to density fluctuations, which rules out a first-order phase transition between inhomogeneous and homogeneous phases."

The mass precision of ${}^{79}$Y and ${}^{83}$Nb is improved to 13 keV and 9.6 keV, respectively. The new $\\alpha$-separation energy of ${}^{84}$Mo, 1.434(83) MeV, unambiguously rules out the possibility of forming the ZrNb cycle. The X-ray burst simulation with the new masses shows that our measurements effectively remove the large final abundance uncertainties in the $A=80-90$ mass region. The new mass values improve the prediction power for the composition of the nuclear ashes in X-ray bursts, including the production of light $p$-nuclei."

We solve the quark gap equation and the background field equation self consistently, which allows us to directly explore the confinement phase transition and furthermore, evaluate the impact of the back-coupling of confinement on chiral symmetry breaking. Moreover, within such a coupled framework towards the complex chemical potential region, we demonstrate the emergence of Roberge-Weiss (RW) symmetry and investigate the trajectory of Lee-Yang edge singularities (LYES). Our analysis reveals that the LYES scaling behavior is similar to our previous findings without the background field condensate. However, a significant difference from our earlier work is that the trajectory of LYES terminates when the imaginary part of the singularity becomes $1/3 \\, \\pi T$. We elaborate that this cut-off behavior is caused by the RW symmetry that is symmetric to the imaginary chemical potential $\\mu_i=1/3 \\, \\pi T$."

However, inferred model parameters can vary significantly with the chosen physics model, highlighting the importance of properly accounting for theoretical uncertainties. In this article, we explicitly incorporate these uncertainties using Gaussian processes that model the domain of validity of theoretical models, integrating prior knowledge about where a theory applies and where it does not. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using two systems: a simple ball drop experiment and multi-stage heavy-ion simulations. In both cases incorporating model discrepancy leads to improved parameter estimates, with systematic improvements observed as additional experimental observables are integrated."

The nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) of leading particles quantifies parton energy loss in such collisions, with the particle spectrum in $p+p$ collisions as a reference. Previous $R_{AA}$ measurements at RHIC energies have revealed an approximately constant trend at high transverse momenta ($p_{T}$), implying a scenario where parton energy loss, $\\Delta p_{T}$, scales proportionally with $p_{T}$, a feature naively expected from energy loss dynamics in elastic collisions. In this study, we investigate the LHC $R_{AA}$ measurements which exhibit a pronounced $p_{T}$ dependence of $R_{AA}$ for various particle species, and our analysis attributes this behavior to $\\Delta p_T$ being approximately proportional to $\\sqrt{p_{T}}$. These distinct features are consistent with model calculations of dominant radiative energy loss dynamics at the LHC, in contrast to the dominance of collisional energy loss at RHIC. Additionally, the linear increase of fractional energy loss with medium density at different $p_{T}$ magnitudes affirms the previous empirical observation that the magnitude of the energy loss depends mostly on the initial entropy density, with no significant path-length dependence. Implications on the dynamical scenarios of parton energy loss and future experimental investigations will also be discussed."

In these environments, matter can reach high temperatures of tens of MeVs and be subject to large magnetic fields. We thus investigate Urca rates at different temperatures and field strengths by performing the full temperature and magnetic-field dependent rate integrals for different equations of state. We find that the magnetic fields play an important role at temperatures of a few MeV, especially close to or below the direct Urca threshold, which is softened by the magnetic field. At higher temperatures, the effect of the magnetic fields can be overshadowed by the thermal effects. We observe that the magnetic field more strongly influences the neutron decay rates than the electron capture rates, leading to a shift in the flavor equilibrium."

The corresponding expressions of Hamiltonian density and single-nucleon potential are derived within the Hartree-Fock approximation under general nonequilibrium conditions. The inclusion of the higher-order derivative terms provides additional higher-order momentum dependence for the single-nucleon potential, and in particular, we find that the N5LO single-nucleon potential with momentum dependent terms up to $p^{10}$ can give a nice description for the empirical nucleon optical potential up to energy of $2$ GeV. At the same time, the density-dependent terms in the extended Skyrme effective interaction are extended correspondingly in the spirit of the Fermi momentum expansion, which allows highly flexible variation of density behavior for both the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state and the symmetry energy. Based on the Skyrme pseudopotential up to N3LO, N4LO and N5LO, we construct a series of interactions with the nucleon optical potential having different high-momentum behaviors and with the symmetry potentials featuring different linear isospin-splitting coefficients for nucleon effective mass, by which we study the properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars. Furthermore, within the lattice BUU transport model, some benchmark simulations with selected interactions are performed for the Au+Au collisions at a beam energy of $1.23$ GeV/nucleon, and the predicted collective flows for protons are found to nicely agree with the data measured by HADES collaboration."

We extend previous calculations of the axial transition form factors from the vacuum (free space) to the nuclear medium (symmetric nuclear matter). The extension of the model to the nuclear medium takes into account the modifications of the properties of hadrons in the medium (masses and coupling constants), as determined by the quark-meson coupling model. The axial-vector ($G_A$) and the induced pseudoscalar ($G_P$) form factors are evaluated for different values of the nuclear density $\\rho$ in terms of the square transfer momentum $q^2= -Q^2$. We conclude that, in general, the $G_A$ and $G_P$ form factors are reduced in the nuclear medium. The reduction is stronger for light baryons and high densities. The medium modifications are milder for the heavier octet baryons, particularly at large $Q^2$. The calculations presented here can be used to estimate the cross sections of neutrino and antineutrino scattering with nucleus, and neutrino and antineutrino scattering with hyperons bound to a nucleus, as well as those in the cores of compact stars."

This theory finds applications across diverse physical systems, including heavy-ion collisions, the early universe, and Weyl/Dirac semimetals. Along with Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) effective theories, holographic models serve as a complementary tool to provide a systematic formulation of CAMHD that goes beyond the weak coupling regime. In this work, we explore holographic models with $U(1)_A \\times U(1)$ symmetry, where the electromagnetic $U(1)$ field is rendered dynamical through mixed boundary conditions applied to the bulk gauge field and the axial anomaly is introduced via a Chern-Simons bulk term. Through a detailed holographic SK analysis, we demonstrate that the low-energy effective action derived from this model aligns precisely with the SK field theory proposed by Landry and Liu and, in fact, it generalizes it to scenarios with finite background axial field. This alignment not only validates the holographic model but also paves the way for its use in exploring unresolved aspects of CAMHD, such as the recently proposed chiral magnetic electric separation wave and nonlinear chiral instabilities."

These refinements substantially improve the model accuracy, not only the accuracy of the barrier height but also the accruacy of the capture cross sections at energies around the Coulomb barrier. The mean value of the deviations (in logarithmic scale) between the predicted cross sections and the data for a total of 426 reaction systems with $ 35 < Z_1 Z_2 < 2600$ is sharply reduced from 3.485 to 0.166."

In the metal-poor stars, the abundance of $^{22}$Ne is limited by the metallicity, so that the contribution of $^{22}$Ne($\\alpha$, n)$^{25}$Mg reaction on the s-process is small. Conversely, the $^{17}$O($\\alpha$, n)$^{20}$Ne reaction is more evident in more metal-poor stars due to the most abundant $^{16}$O in all metallicities. In this work, we calculate the evolution of four metal-poor models ($Z=10^{-3}$) for the Zero-Age Main-Sequence (ZAMS) masses of $M ({\\rm ZAMS})=$ 15, 20, 25, and 30 M$_{\\odot}$ to investigate the effect of reaction rates on the ws-process. We adopt the new $^{17}$O($\\alpha$, n)$^{20}$Ne and $^{17}$O($\\alpha, \\gamma$)$^{21}$Ne reaction rates suggested by Wiescher et al. (2023) and $^{22}$Ne($\\alpha$, n)$^{25}$Mg and $^{22}$Ne($\\alpha, \\gamma$)$^{26}$Mg from Best et al. (2013). The yields of the s-process isotope with updated reaction rates are compared with the results using default reaction rates from JINA REACLIB. We find that the effects of new $^{17}$O+$\\alpha$ are much more significant than those of new $^{22}$Ne+$\\alpha$ reaction rates in the non-rotation stars."

As long as $|\\Delta/\\mu|$ is dominant over the derivative, the gap effects increase the speed of sound, which is consistent with the expected behavior of exhibiting a peak at intermediate density. We then discuss the trace anomaly which is pushed down generally by the gap effects and turns out to be negative widely in the high density regime. For demonstration of non-perturbative enhancement, we take account of the instanton-induced interaction. We confirm a further increase in the speed of sound for the two-color diquark superfluid and the pion-condensed high-isospin matter, while the speed of sound for the 2SC quark matter deviates far below the conformal limit due to the derivative contribution."

The current study shows that this decay channel can provide a useful probe for physics beyond the standard model. We use the helicity formalism while employing the effective theory approach where we include the effects of vector and axial vector ‘new’ physics (NP) operators. In this study, we have computed the branching ratio , the helicity fraction fL, the lepton forward–backward asymmetry , and the lepton flavor universality ratio (LFU) . In addition, as a complementary check on the LFU, we also calculate the various other LFU observables, where i = AFB, fL. We assume that the NP universal coupling is present for both muons and tauons, while the non-universal coupling is only present for muons. Regarding these couplings, we employ the latest global fit to the b → sℓ+ℓ− data, which is recently computed in Algueró etal [Eur. Phys. J. C83 648 (2023)]. We give predictions of some of the mentioned observables within the SM and the various NP scenarios. We have found that not only are the considered observables sensitive to NP but are also helpful in distinguishing among the different NP scenarios. These results can be tested at the LHCb, HL-LHC, and FCC-ee, and therefore, a precise measurements of these observables not only deepens our understanding of the b → sℓ+ℓ− process but also provides a window of opportunity to possibly study various NP scenarios."

The discovery of the N1/2+(1880) resonance in pion photoproduction but not in πN scattering and the small width of the N1/2+(1710) resonance suggest that a state associated with these resonances would be insensitive to the manner in which pions are permitted to dress it. To explore this possibility, we examine the spectrum of nucleon radial excitations in both 2 + 1 flavour QCD and in simulations where the coupling to meson-baryon states is significantly modified through quenching. We find the energy of the 2s radial excitation to be insensitive to this modification for quark masses close to the physical point. This invariance provides further evidence that the 2s radial excitation of the nucleon is associated with the N1/2+(1880) and N1/2+(1710) resonances."

By assuming a constant mass profile within the kinetic theory approach, we examine the collective behavior of a system of massive relativistic particles within the Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution. We derive the two-point retarded correlation functions for both charge and energy-momentum tensor components at arbitrary momentum and frequency values. To obtain analytical results, we expand relations for very small and large mass-to-temperature ratios ($m/T$). For large ratios, no significant effects are observed in the charge, shear, or sound propagation channels. However, for small ratios in the charge correlation function within the hydrodynamic limit, the mass tends to shift the hydrodynamic poles toward the unstable region, i.e., $\\text{Im}(\\omega) \\geq 0$. This instability emerges at a critical value of $(m/T)_c \\simeq 1.234$. Furthermore, in the sound channel, the mass amplifies the standard propagating sound mode, converting it into a purely (positive) imaginary mode. Consequently, all modes in this channel become purely imaginary, with instability becoming a dominant characteristic. In contrast, in the shear channel, all modes converge to their massless limits. Similar to the massless case, a threshold value exists for $(k \\tau)$, below which the correlators exhibit solutions. We find that hydrodynamic poles arise in the strong coupling regime, while the weak coupling regime features a logarithmic branch cut between $\\omega = k$ and $\\omega = -k$ that is analogous to the massless scenario. Additionally, we derive the shear and bulk viscosity transport coefficients, along with other coefficients up to third order in gradients, as an expansion in terms of small $(m/T)$."

Low-energy model studies suggest $^{238}$U may have a modest octupole deformation arising from collective vibrational degrees of freedom, in addition to a large prolate shape. We investigated the impact of this modest octupole shape on observables involving triangular flow ($v_3$) in high-energy nuclear collisions. Using a hydrodynamic framework, we show $v_3$ and its correlation with mean transverse momentum, $\\langle v_3^2 \\delta\\pT \\rangle$, exhibit strong sensitivity to $\\beta_3$. We found that $\\langle v_3^2\\rangle$ follows a linear increase with $\\beta_3^2$, while $\\langle v_3^2 \\delta\\pT \\rangle$ is suppressed in the presence of $\\beta_3$. Our findings show that the collective-flow-assisted nuclear imaging method in high-energy nuclear collisions, when compared with experimental data, can provide unique constraints on higher-order deformations."

It offers a very systematical ranking of the significance of nuclear-structure observables in reaction calculations. This greatly helps to infer reliable structure information from reaction cross sections. However, for a meaningful analysis, the Halo-EFT scheme needs to have converged. Purpose: In a previous study [P. Capel, D. R. Phillips, and H.-W. Hammer, Phys. Rev. C 98, 034610 (2018)], NLO descriptions of 11Be have been developed and lead to excellent agreement with existing breakup data. However, the convergence of the scheme at NLO was not fully demonstrated. Moreover, a significant dependence on the regulator of the effective 10Be-n interaction has been observed. Method: We develop Halo-EFT descriptions of 11Be at N2LO and use them in an accurate breakup-reaction code. We compare our theoretical cross sections with experiment on Pb and C targets at about 70 MeV/nucleon. Results: On Pb, the N2LO descriptions of 11Be lead to little change to the NLO results of the previous study, confirming the convergence of that scheme. On C, the reaction is significantly affected by the presence of d resonances in the low-energy spectrum of 11Be. In the Halo-EFT power counting these resonances appear only at N2LO; our new descriptions include them naturally. Going to N2LO removes also the cutoff dependence observed in the previous study. Conclusions: We demonstrate the convergence of the Halo-EFT description of 11Be at NLO for Coulomb breakup and at N2LO for nuclear-dominated dissociation. The reliability of the nuclear-structure information inferred in the previous study is thus confirmed."

We find that the most probable value of $X$ evolves from around 0.7 to 1.0 as the beam energy $E_{beam}/A$ increases. On the other hand, the posterior PDF($K$) may have dual peaks having roughly the same height or extended shoulders at high $K$ values. More quantitatively, the posterior PDF($K$) changes from having a major peak around 220 MeV characterizing a soft EOS in the reaction at $E_{beam}/A$=150 MeV to one that peaks around 320 MeV indicating a stiff EOS in the reactions at $E_{beam}/A$ higher than about 600 MeV. The transition from soft to stiff happens in mid-central Au+Au reactions at beam energies around 250 MeV/nucleon in which $K=220$ MeV and $K=320$ MeV are approximately equally probable. Altogether, the FOPI proton flow excitation function data indicate a gradual hardening of hot and dense nuclear matter as its density and temperature increase in reactions with higher beam energies."

Resonance proton scattering of exotic nuclide on a thick target in inverse kinematics can be used to infer the properties of the low-energy neutron scattering of this nuclide assuming the isobaric symmetry. However, the results of such resonance proton scattering reactions are so far analyzed in theoretical approaches (optical, R-matrix models), which are missing important aspects of isospin dynamics, isospin violation in continuum and threshold dynamics. The isospin conserving coupled-channel model (ICM) is proposed, which provides a more reliable basis for understanding of such experimental studies. Qualitatively different phase shifts for the $^{8}$He+$p$ $T=5/2$ and $T=3/2$ resonances are predicted by ICM with quite unusual profile for the $T=5/2$ states. Alternative interpretation of the existing $^{8}$He+$p$ data is proposed. The observable properties of the $T=5/2$ resonances may be strongly affected by the isobaric-partner $T=3/2$ states.

The hadronic phase contains various massive hadrons with an abundance of the lightest hadron, i.e., $\\pi$-mesons (pions). In this paper, we consider that pions are in thermal equilibrium in the hadronic phase and use second-order viscous hydrodynamics for a medium of massive pions to obtain its expansion to the boundary of the kinetic freeze-out. We achieve the kinetic freeze-out boundary with the Knudsen number $Kn>1$ limit. When this condition is met, hydrodynamics expansion breaks down, and the mean free path becomes sufficiently large in comparison with the system size so that the particle yields are preserved. Further, we investigate the effect of the massive fluid on the resonance particle yields, including re-scattering and regeneration, along with the natural decay widths of the resonances. The resonances can play an essential role in determining the characteristics of the hadronic phase as they have sufficiently small lifetimes, which may be comparable to the hadronic phase lifetime. In the current study, we predict the hadronic phase lifetime, which is further used to determine the $K^*(892)^0/K$, $\\phi(1020)/K$, and $\\rho(770)^0/\\pi$ yield ratios at the kinetic freeze-out.

We have also compared our findings with the results of the novel RTA, the standard RTA and the standard BGK models. Our observation shows that the novel collision integrals for both the RTA and BGK models decrease the charge and the heat transport phenomena in the medium, as evidenced by the reduced values of the transport coefficients, such as the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity, when compared to the standard RTA and standard BGK models. Furthermore, certain observables, such as the thermal diffusion constant and the Lorenz number have been explored using the novel approaches of the aforesaid models. We have found an overall decreasing trend of the thermal diffusion constant with the temperature in the novel BGK model, similar to the novel RTA model, but the magnitude remains higher throughout the temperature range. However, the magnitude of the thermal diffusion constant in the proposed novel BGK model remains lower than its value in the standard BGK model. The magnitude of the Lorenz number in the novel BGK model remains higher than that in the standard BGK model, but it is lower than that in the novel RTA model. We have also observed that the Lorenz number in all cases has an increasing trend at low temperatures, showing a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law, whereas at high temperatures, it becomes saturated. The Lorenz number remaining above unity indicates that the thermal conductivity prevails over the electrical conductivity in the aforesaid models."

Adiabatic Hydrodynamization (AH) has been proposed as a framework with which to describe, explain, and predict attractor behavior that draws upon an analogy to the adiabatic approximation in quantum mechanics. In this work, we systematize the description of pre-hydrodynamic attractors in kinetic theory by showing how to use the AH framework to identify these long-lived solutions to which varied initial conditions rapidly evolve, demonstrating the robustness of this framework. In a simplified QCD kinetic theory in the small-angle scattering limit, we use AH to explain both the early- and late-time scaling behavior of a longitudinally expanding gluon gas in a unified framework. In this context, we show that AH provides a unified description of, and intuition for, all the stages of what in QCD would be bottom-up thermalization, starting from a pre-hydrodynamic attractor and ending with hydrodynamization. We additionally discuss the connection between the notions of scaling behavior and adiabaticity and the crucial role of time-dependent coordinate redefinitions in identifying the degrees of freedom of kinetic theories that give rise to attractor solutions. The tools we present open a path to the intuitive explanation of how attractor behavior arises and how the attractor evolves in all stages of the hydrodynamization of QGP in heavy ion collisions."

This paper presents a theoretical study of HQ jet yield suppression in Pb+Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and focuses on the energy loss of HQ jets produced by different mechanisms. The p+p baseline is provided by the generator simulation of high-energy reactions of particles (SHERPA), and the jet-medium interactions are described by the SHELL transport model, which considers the elastic and inelastic partonic energy loss in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In p+p collisions, our numerical results indicate that the HQ jets from gluon splitting ( -jet) are the dominant contribution at high , displaying more dispersive structures than the HQ-initiated ( -jet). In nucleus-nucleus collisions, our calculations were consistent with the inclusive and b-jet recently measured by the ATLAS collaboration, revealing a remarkable manifestation of the mass effect of jet energy loss. As a result of the dispersive substructure, the -jet loses more energy than the -jet in the QGP. Due to the significant contribution of -jet, the of c-jet is comparable or even smaller than that of inclusive jet. To experimentally distinguish the -jet and -jet, we propose event selection strategies based on their topological features and test their performances. By isolating the -jet, -jet, and the jets initiated by heavy quarks, we predicted that the order of their are in line with the mass hierarchy of energy loss. Future measurements on the of -jet and -jet will provide a unique opportunity for testing the flavor/mass dependence of energy loss at the jet level."

For the chosen systems, simple Wong formula-based calculations are found to be unable to describe actual fusion data at sub-barrier energies. The inclusion of quadrupole deformation with an additional radius parameter in deformed choice of nuclear potential along with the simple Wong formula is capable of retracing experimental data. In the SAGBD model, the simple Wong formula is weighted by a Gaussian function. The SAGBD model with different choices of diffuseness has been explored, and fusion yields have been found to be relatively sensitive to the choice of diffuseness of Woods-Saxon potential. SAGBD outcomes with Winther and Akyüz-Winther diffuseness are unable to retrieve experimental data. To improve theoretical predictions, the diffuseness is optimized relative to Winther and Akyüz-Winther value, and theoretical outcomes with an optimized diffuseness parameter within SAGBD model address the fusion behaviour of 40Ca + 46,48,50Ti reactions well. Coupled channel analysis of given reactions, wherein the influences of low-lying vibrational states of participants are directly considered, readily reproduced the fusion data for all studied systems. The low-lying vibrational 2+ and 3– states are found to be sufficient to reproduce the fusion data for 40Ca + 46,48Ti reactions. However, for 40Ca + 50Ti reactions, in addition to low-lying 2+ and 3– vibrational states, the considerations of a pair neutron transfer channel is required to address sub-barrier fusion data."

      "summary": "In this study, we investigate the properties of black holes within the framework of multi-fractional theories of gravity, focusing on the effects of q-derivatives and weighted derivatives. These modifications, which introduce scale-dependent spacetime geometries, alter black hole solutions in intriguing ways. Within these frameworks, we analyze two key observable phenomena - black hole shadows and particle deflection angle in the weak field limit - using both analytical techniques and observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) for M87* and Sgr A*. The study using the q-derivative formalism reveals that the multi-scale length influences the size of the black hole shadow in two ways and modifies the weak deflection angle. Constraints on are derived from the EHT observations, showing significant deviations from standard Schwarzschild black hole predictions, which range from to orders of magnitude. Additionally, the weak deflection angle is computed using the non-asymptotic generalization of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (GBT) to reveal the effects of finite-distance and multi-scale parameters. Using the Sun in the Solar System test, we observe that the constraints for range from to orders of magnitude. Results from the weighted derivative formalism generate a dS/AdS-like behavior, where smaller deviations are found in the strong field regime than in the weak field regime. The results suggest that, while these effects are subtle, they provide a potential observational signature of quantum gravity effects. The findings presented here contribute to the broader effort of testing alternative theories of gravity through black hole observations, offering a new perspective on the quantum structure of spacetime at cosmological and astrophysical scales."

The AdS boundary hosts a Gaussian oscillation source, which induces a lensed response on the opposite side of the boundary during propagation through bulk spacetime. The optical system enables observers at the north pole to continuously capture holographic images that exhibit an axisymmetric bright ring known as the Einstein ring. As the observation position shifts, the bright ring gradually transforms into a luminous arc and eventually transitions into a light point. Additionally, we examine the impact of variations in relevant physical quantities on the ring and present the corresponding brightness curve. The results indicate that, as the temperature T and nonlinear Yang Mills charge parameter q increase, the ring radius increases, whereas an increase in chemical potential u leads to a decrease in ring radius. However, the peak brightness curve of the ring invariably decreases as the values of T, u, and q increase, albeit to varying degrees. Comparing the outcomes of geometric optics, we observe that the position of the ring in holography images is consistent with that of the photon ring."

By solving the Einstein equation, we derive the corrected Schwarzschild-AdS black hole with Lorentzian distribution and analyze the thermodynamics. Our results confirm that if the energy-momentum tensor outside the event horizon is related to the mass of the black hole, the conventional first law of thermodynamics will be violated. The study of criticality reveals that the black hole undergoes a small black hole-large black hole phase transition similar to that of the Van der Waals system, with a critical point and critical ratio slightly smaller than that of the Van der Waals fluid. As the non-commutative parameter increases, the phase transition process shortens, leading to a critical point, and ultimately to the disappearance of the phase transition. The violation of the conventional first law results in a discontinuity of the Gibbs free energy during the phase transition, indicating the occurrence of zeroth-order phase transition. Moreover, we investigate the Joule-Thomson expansion, obtaining the minimum inversion temperature and minimum inversion mass."

These processes involve, for instance, the collective anisotropic flows in heavy-ion collisions, or the diffractive production of vector mesons in photo-nuclear ($\\gamma A$) interactions. In this paper, we use a classical approximation and simple analytical models in order to exhibit characteristic and universal features of ground-state correlation functions that result from the presence of a deformed intrinsic state. In the case of a small axial quadrupole deformation, we show that the random rotation of the intrinsic density of the nucleus leads to a specific quadrupole modulation of the lab-frame two-body density as a function of the relative azimuthal angle. As a phenomenological, albeit academic application, we analyze the diffractive production of vector mesons in high-energy $\\gamma+^8$Be collisions. This demonstrates with the simplest deformed nucleus how the two-body correlations impact the $|t|$ dependence of the incoherent cross sections."

Information about the medium modifications of the internal structure of the hadrons are fundamental for the study of dense nuclear matter and high energy processes including heavy-ion and nucleus-nucleus collisions. At the moment, however, the empirical information about the medium modifications of the hadrons is limited, therefore, theoretical studies are essential for the progress in the field. In the present work we review theoretical studies of the electromagnetic and axial form factors of octet baryons in symmetric nuclear matter. The calculations are based on a model that takes into account the degrees of freedom revealed on experimental studies of the low and intermediate square transfer momentum $q^2=-Q^2$: valence quarks and meson cloud excitations of the baryon cores. The formalism combines a covariant constituent quark model, developed for the free space (vacuum) with the quark-meson coupling model for the extension to the nuclear medium. We conclude that the nuclear medium modifies the baryon properties differently according to the flavor content of the baryons and the medium density. The effects of the medium increase with the density, and are stronger (quenched or enhanced) for light baryons than for heavy baryons. In particular, the in-medium neutrino-nucleon and antineutrino-nucleon cross sections are reduced compared to the values in free space. The proposed formalism can be extended to densities above the normal nuclear density and applied to neutrino-hyperon and antineutrino-hyperon scattering in dense nuclear matter."

The present work explores the effect of the Coriolis force, arising due to this rotation, on the shear viscosity of the medium. Using the relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory framework, we analyze the parallel (\\(\\eta_{||}/s\\)), perpendicular (\\(\\eta_\\perp/s\\)) and Hall (\\(\\eta_\\times/s\\)) components of shear viscosity to entropy density ratio under rotation. The estimation of anisotropic shear viscosity components is carried out using hadron resonance gas degrees of freedom below the critical (transition) temperature and massless partonic degrees of freedom above this temperature. Our results show that rotation suppresses the shear viscosity of the medium, with the degree of suppression depending on the ratio between the relaxation time and the rotational period. In the context of realistic heavy-ion collision experiments, the temperature and angular velocity both decrease with time, and one can establish a connection between them through the standard approximate cooling law. For a temperature-dependent angular velocity \\(\\Omega(T)\\), we obtain a traditional valley-like pattern for all components \\(\\eta_{||}/s\\), \\(\\eta_\\perp/s\\) and \\(\\eta_\\times/s\\) with reduced magnitudes compared to the valley-like isotropic $\\eta/s$ one encounters in the absence of rotation."

It has three instanton types or flavors with distinct actions. For weak coupling and subject to there being a single large (or small) parameter, the interactive system can be handled perturbatively. The zero mode problem arising from time translation symmetry is handled via the Fadeev-Popov procedure. A diagrammatic procedure allows corrections to the fluctuation determinant to be calculated systematically. Independent instanton contributions are summed over by extending the dilute gas approximation to three flavors and energy splittings of the lowest four states is calculated. All tunneling amplitudes are concisely expressed in terms of elementary functions.

Interestingly, the magnetized BM-spacetime introduces not only two domain walls but a series of domain walls. However, we focus on the range \\(r \\in [0,\\pi/\\sqrt{2\\Lambda}]\\). A quantum particle remains indefinitely confined within this range and cannot be found elsewhere. Based on these findings, we report the effects of rainbow gravity on KG bosonic fields in BM-spacetime.

Furthermore, the Sliding Dumbbell Method (SDM) is employed to identify potential CME-like events within each data set. The identified events selected using the SDM exhibit characteristics consistent with CME. The CME fraction in these events is quantified while accounting for background contributions."

In this work we show that, based on the performance of currently operating detectors using the same technology and a realistic reduction of radioactivity in detector materials, such an experiment will also be able to competitively search for neutrinoless double beta decay in 136Xe using a natural-abundance xenon target. XLZD can reach a 3σ discovery potential half-life of 5.7 × 1027 years (and a 90% CL exclusion of 1.3 × 1028 years) with 10 years of data taking, corresponding to a Majorana mass range of 7.3–31.3 meV (4.8–20.5 meV). XLZD will thus exclude the inverted neutrino mass ordering parameter space and will start to probe the normal ordering region for most of the nuclear matrix elements commonly considered by the community."

The weak-interaction mediated processes, namely the $\\beta$-decay and electron capture, significantly change the lepton to baryon ratio and accelerate the contraction of the core. The emission of resulting neutrinos/antineutrinos tends to cool the stellar core. On the other hand, gamma rays are produced because of electron capture and $\\beta$-decay to excited states in daughter nuclei. These gamma rays heat the core and contribute to an increase of entropy which may cause convection to occur.\n  In the present work, the weak-interaction heating and cooling rates on a chain of twenty-two isotopes of vanadium having mass in the range $43-64$ have been estimated using the proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation theory. The rates have been computed for the temperature ranging from ($10^{7} - 3 \\times 10^{10}$)\\;K and for the density range ($10-10^{11}$)\\;g/cm$^{3}$. Our calculated neutrino energy loss rates have also been compared with the previously reported rates calculated using other theoretical models.

In this work, we investigate the effective transport and thermodynamic coefficients in non-central O+O light-ion collisions, considering a parton distribution function that incorporates the spin polarization induced by thermal vorticity during the collision. Using a kinetic theory approach, we find that while the speed of sound squared ($c_s^2$) remains largely unaffected by spin polarization, the specific shear viscosity ($\\eta/s$), specific bulk viscosity ($\\zeta/s$), and mean free path ($\\lambda$) are significantly modified.\n  Notably, when spin polarization is taken into account, both $c_s^2 $ and $\\zeta/s$ exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on collision energy, with an inflection point around $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 27 $~GeV, corresponding to an average parton chemical potential of $\\langle\\mu_p\\rangle = 0.021 $~GeV.

High-energy QCD is a robust subject and my research is refined to the sub-field of small-$x$ spin physics; small-$x$ physics is characterized by high-energy and density collisions and is well-suited for the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective field theory. Small-$x$ spin physics takes the ultra-relativistic description of high-energy QCD and gives special attention to spin-dependent interactions suppressed by powers of the center-of-mass energy. My expertise lies in exploring the theory and phenomenology relating to the KPS-CTT small-$x$ helicity evolution equations, a rubric that allows one to make predictions of the quarks' and gluons' distributions of spin at small-$x$. These predictions are heavily influenced by the initial conditions of the evolution, and the initial conditions are determined through analyses of world polarized data. My contributions focus on Bayesian parameter analysis, numerical and analytical calculations to discretize and cross-check the evolution equations, and the incorporation of a new observable into the pool of analyzed data. The results of such work show that the net amount of spin from quarks and gluons in the small-$x$ regime is predicted to be negative and/or potentially small; an analysis of polarized deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) and semi-inclusive DIS (SIDIS) data resulted in a net small-$x$ spin prediction that can be large and negative, but new results with the inclusion of data for single-inclusive jet production in polarized proton-proton ($pp$) collisions now estimate that the net amount of parton spin at small $x$ is small, with 1-$\\sigma$ uncertainty that spans zero."

However, a naive power counting can be violated due to the presence of various hard scales in a given scheme. A typical example of such a scale is an ultraviolet regulator. This issue is particularly challenging when the interaction is nonperturbative. The power counting is expected to be restored in the course of renormalization, that is by redefining bare low-energy constants in the effective Lagrangian. Whether this procedure eventually leads to a self-consistent framework is not a priory obvious. We discuss various criteria of renormalizability in application to nuclear chiral effective field theory and provide several instructive counterexamples."

The parameters in these interactions are determined from either experimental information if any or chiral effective field theory or lattice QCD calculations of the hyperon potentials in nuclear matter around nuclear saturation density $\\rho_0$. We find that varying the high density behavior of the symmetry energy $E_{\\rm sym}(\\rho)$ can significantly change the critical density for hyperon appearance in the neutron stars and thus the maximum mass $M_{\\rm TOV}$ of static hyperon stars. In particular, a symmetry energy which is soft around $2-3\\rho_0$ but stiff above about $4\\rho_0$, can lead to $M_{\\rm TOV} \\gtrsim 2M_\\odot$ for hyperon stars and simultaneously be compatible with (1) the constraints on the equation of state of symmetric nuclear matter at suprasaturation densities obtained from flow data in heavy-ion collisions; (2) the microscopic calculations of the equation of state for pure neutron matter; (3) the star tidal deformability extracted from gravitational wave signal GW170817; (4) the mass-radius relations of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0437-4715 measured from NICER; (5) the observation of the unusually low mass and small radius in the central compact object of HESS J1731-347. Furthermore, the sound speed squared of the hyperon star matter naturally displays a strong peak structure around baryon density of $3-4\\rho_0$, consistent with the model-independent analysis on the multimessenger data. Our results suggest that the high density symmetry energy could be a key to the solution of the hyperon puzzle in neutron star physics."

In this study, we compute theoretical predictions and compare them with experimental data from Miner$\\nu$a and T2K for inclusive (anti)neutrino cross-sections. The scaling function is derived within the CDFM framework, employing a relativistic effective mass of $m_N^*$ = 0.8 $m_N$. The findings demonstrate a high degree of consistency with experimental data across all (anti)neutrino energy ranges."

The combination of this physics-informed input with hyperparameter optimization via the Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC) significantly enhances predictive performance.

The binding energy and radii are compared with the results obtained from relativistic Hartree calculations along with the experimental data, wherever available, to check the reliability of the methods. The calculations are extended to estimate the giant monopole resonances to understand the collective vibration of the nucleons for such superheavy nuclei. The giant monopole resonances obtained from scaling calculations are compared with the constraint computations. Furthermore, the results are compared with other known methods, such as the relativistic Random Phase Approximation (RPA) and time-dependent mean field calculations, along with some known lighter nuclei, specifically Zr isotopes (N = 42-86) and O isotopes (N = 10-36).

For the Equation-of-State we employ a density and momentum dependent potential from the Chiral-Mean-Field model.

The directed flow $v_1$ of p, d, t, $^3$He, $^4$He as well as the $\\Lambda$, $^3_\\Lambda$H and $^4_\\Lambda$H is shown to approximately scale with mass number $A$ of the light cluster in both calculations.

The analysis explores this property across different rapidity ranges, collision centralities, and collision energies, while also examining the roles of multi-parton interactions (MPI) and color reconnection (CR) mechanisms. The results show that the light nuclei yield ratio remains stable with changes in rapidity coverage and collision centrality but slightly increases with rising collision energy. The impact of CR on the light nuclei yield ratio depends entirely on the presence of MPI; when MPI is turned off, CR has no effect. Additionally, the three-nucleon correlation, enhances the light nuclei yield ratio in both central and peripheral collisions. However, the non-monotonic energy dependence observed in experiments, the peak at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = $20\\sim30$ GeV reported by the STAR experiment, cannot be explained by the Angantyr model due to its lack of key mechanisms related to the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).

The corresponding moments of the binary collision integral are obtained in terms of quadratic products of different moments of the anisotropic distribution function and couple to a well defined set of lower-order moments. To illustrate these results we compare the moments of the binary collision integral to the moments of the widely used relaxation-time approximation of Anderson and Witting in case of a spheroidal distribution function. We found that in an expanding system the nonlinear Boltzmann collision term leads to twice slower equilibration than the relaxation-time approximation. Furthermore we also show that including two dynamical moments helps to resolve the ambiguity which additional moment of the Boltzmann equation to choose to close the conservation laws."

We show that the Gaussian ansatz allows us, via the gravitational Ward identities acting as a constraint between the variance and the average, to maintain full general covariance, with hydrodynamic flow emerging as an approximate Killing vector. If the symmetry of relativistic hydrodynamics, volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, is preserved, we show that linear response formulae are also generally covariant. We discuss our results and argue that in this approach, the applicability of the effective theory is parametrized around a very different quantity than the Knudsen number, offering hope of understanding the applicability of hydrodynamics to small systems."

Previous studies show that the type-I and -II regions are coupled magnetically, when macroscopic flux tubes divide dendritically into quantized flux tubes near the type-I-II interface, through a process known as flux branching. The studies assume that the normal-superconducting boundary is sharp, and the quantized flux tubes do not repel mutually. Here the sharp-interface approximation is refined by accounting for magnetic repulsion. It is found that flux tubes in the same flux tree cluster with a minimum-energy separation two to seven times less than that of isolated flux tubes. Neutron vortices pin and cluster about flux trees. We find that the maximum characteristic wave strain $h_0$ of the current quadrupole gravitational radiation emitted by a rectilinear array of clustered vortices exceeds by $(1+N_{\\rm v,t})^{1/2}$ the strain $h_0 \\sim 10^{-32}(f/30 {\\rm Hz})^{5/2} (D/1 {\\rm kpc})^{-1}$ emitted by uniformly distributed vortices, where $N_{\\rm v,t}$ is the mean number of pinned vortices per flux tree, $f$ is the star's spin frequency, and $D$ is the star's distance from Earth. The factor $(1 + N_{\\rm v,t})^{1/2}$ brings $h_0$ close to the sensitivity limit of the current generation of interferometric gravitational wave detectors under certain circumstances, specifically when flux branching forms relatively few (and hence relatively large) flux trees."

If this transition occurs sufficiently close to the physical point, its universal critical behaviour would largely control the physics of the QCD phase transition. We quantify the size of this region in QCD using functional approaches, both Dyson-Schwinger equations and the functional renormalisation group. The latter allows us to study both critical and non-critical effects on equal footing, facilitating a precise determination of the scaling regime. We find that the physical point is far away from the critical region. Importantly, we show that the physics of the chiral crossover is dominated by soft modes even far beyond the critical region. While scaling functions determine all thermodynamic properties of the system in the critical region, the order parameter potential is the relevant quantity away from it. We compute this potential in QCD using the functional renormalisation group and Dyson-Schwinger equations and provide a simple parametrisation for phenomenological applications."

We compare results of the perturbative $\\epsilon$ expansion approach with those obtained via the FRG, evaluated directly in $d=3$ dimensions. The perturbative results suggest that the fixed-point structure is more intricate than that of three-color QCD, a conclusion further supported by the FRG analysis. Both methods display an infrared stable $O(6)$ fixed point at infinite axial anomaly; however, the FRG approach also reveals the existence of $U_A(1)$ anomaly-free fixed points, which can become infrared stable if the anomaly in the underlying theory vanishes at the critical temperature. These findings imply that the phase transition can be of second order, consistent with earlier findings for three colors."

The main purpose of this study is to probe the findings of the Cole et al. paper. This study gives useful information on the performance of QRPA-based nuclear models. As per simulation results, the capturing of electrons that occur on medium heavy isotopes have a significant role in decreasing the ratio of electron-to-baryon content of the stellar interior during the late stages of core evolution. We report the calculation of allowed charge-changing transitions strength for odd-A fp-shell nuclei (45Sc and 55Mn) by employing the deformed pn-QRPA approach. The computed GT transition strength is compared with previous theoretical calculations and measured data. For stellar applications the corresponding electron capture rates are computed and compared with rates using previously calculated and measured Gamow-Teller values. Our finding show that our calculated results are in decent accordance with measured data. At higher stellar temperature our calculated electron capture rates are larger than those calculated by Independent Particle Model (IPM) and shell model. It was further concluded that at low temperature and high density regions the positron emission weak-rates from 45Sc and 55Mn may be neglected in simulation codes."

Heavy-quarks are produced predominantly in the initial hard partonic interactions, allowing them to witness the entire evolution process. The charm hadrons are produced in two ways. Firstly, the prompt charm hadrons which are formed from the charm quark hadronization which are produced directly from the initial hard-scatterings or the decay of other excited charm states. Secondly, the nonprompt charm hadrons which are produced from the decay of beauty hadrons. The produced charm hadrons then usually decay to light-flavor hadrons or leptons via two or three body decay. The reconstruction of charm hadrons is challenging due to the large combinatorial background as well as the difficulty of distinguishing between prompt and non-prompt charm hadrons. In this work, we use machine learning models--XGboost and Deep Neural Network--to reconstruct $\\Lambda_c^{+} (udc)$ hadrons via its three body final state decay channel, $\\Lambda_c^{+} \\rightarrow pK^0_s$ and $K^0_s \\rightarrow \\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$.

We demonstrate these scaling properties through a derived relation based on the general structure of equal-time commutators among Poincare charges and their densities. This relation is applicable to any renormalizable fields with spin $\\leq 1$, excluding gauge fields. In this particular study, we investigate a rigidly rotating solution ($\\Omega = \\text{const}$) at global equilibrium for massless fermionic matter. It has been shown that the applicability of a hydrodynamic description requires a hierarchy $\\Omega R \\gg \\Omega \\beta_{0}$, where $R$ is the radius of the cylindrical-shaped rotating matter and $\\beta_{0} = 1/T_{0}$ is the inverse temperature on the rotation axis. Consequently, the thermodynamic free energy $\\Phi$ depends on the angular velocity through the product $\\Omega R$, a dependency that extends to other thermodynamic variables as well. These findings are consistent with recent lattice QCD simulation results. Furthermore, we compute the moment of inertia for massless fermions and estimate the light quark contribution to the total moment of inertia of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in heavy-ion collisions."

Furthermore, the phenomenon of isospin distillation, intrinsically related to the unstable part of the system, is also described. In order to estimate the impact of the finite range of the nuclear interaction, for each Gogny parametrization we provide a respective zero-range Skyrme version, for which the free parameters of the model are obtained with the aim of reproducing at zero temperature the same saturation density, binding energy, incompressibility, isoscalar effective mass, isovector effective mass, symmetry energy, and symmetry energy slope. As a main result, we verify systematic deviations between the Gogny models and their Skyrme-version models, particularly at higher temperatures, where the Skyrme-version parametrizations exhibit reduced binodal and spinodal regions."

We have compared the impacts of nuclear size and nucleus structure on deformation probes in relativistic heavy-ion collisions based on a multiphase transport (AMPT) model. With increasing nucleon size, the absolute values of the deformation probes are generally reduced due to smeared initial density fluctuations. In heavy systems such as $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au collisions, neglecting the nucleon size could underestimate or overestimate significantly the extracted deformation parameter depending on the used deformation probe, while the scaled anisotropic flow and the scaled Pearson correlation coefficient of flow and transverse momentum are good probes of the nucleus deformation rather insensitive to the nucleon size. In small systems such as $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions, the deformation probes are generally more sensitive to the nucleon size than to the nucleus structure, and the transverse momentum fluctuation less sensitive to detailed nucleus structure may serve as a good probe of the nucleon size."

We explore two initial-state modifications to resolve this puzzle: (1) enforcing a minimum nucleon separation distance to homogenize distributions, and (2) amplifying sub-nucleon structures to reduce initial eccentricity. Using TRENTo initial conditions and 3+1D viscous hydrodynamic model CLVisc, both approaches significantly lower geometric eccentricity, reduce required viscosity, and narrow the $v_2$-$v_3$ gap in ultra-central collisions.

In this letter, we propose a novel global odd-even staggering (OES) feature in $\\alpha$ decay, which emerges during the clustering process.

By combining U4F with the large-scale configuration-interaction approach, we demonstrate that the OES effect in $\\alpha$ decay arises from the suppression of clustering correlations due to unpaired nucleons. These findings significantly advance our understanding of cluster formation in nuclei and have important implications for the production of new elements and nuclear synthesis in the universe."

Thus, the FRG-QCD results can still not be well understood, especially why the CEP should locate at the entrances of moat regimes for $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ mesons. Nevertheless, some basic features can be understood qualitatively, and it is consistent that the pole energies are increasing functions of momenta in the whole $T-\\mu_{\\rm B}$ plane.

The type of D$\\chi$SB is classified based on the sign of the second derivative of the free energy density with respect to the quark condensate at the origin. We perform numerical simulations of the interacting instanton liquid model with the flavor SU(2) symmetric and (2+1)-flavor quarks. We find that the curvature is negative in the SU(2) case. This means the ordinary type of D$\\chi$SB. In contrast, in the (2+1)-flavor case, a positive curvature is observed when the strange quark mass is as small as those of the up and down quarks. This suggests that the anomaly-driven type of D$\\chi$SB can occur under the approximate flavor SU(3) symmetry. As the strange quark mass increases, the curvature gradually decreases and becomes negative when the strange quark mass is approximately three times larger than those of the light quarks. This difference can be understood in terms of the 't Hooft vertex which induces a six-quark interaction in the $N_f=3$ case and does a four-quark interaction in the $N_f=2$ case. Our results might indicate that the ratio between the strange and light quark masses plays a crucial role in understanding the microscopic relationship between D$\\chi$SB and the anomaly effect."

The dissipation in the free part of our EFT follows the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation (RTA). The interaction part of the EFT is constructed based on the self-interaction of the density field.

We then explicitly compute the symmetrized three-point function at tree level, and investigate its analytical structure in detail. We also analytically calculate the branch-point singularity that appears in the structure of the two-point response function due to loop effects.

This friction is often modeled as a Navier-Stokes shear viscosity. However, non-Newtonian corrections are expected to appear at distances of about one optical depth from the layers' interface. Such corrections prevent the viscous stress from becoming too large. Here, we set the foundations of a rigorous theory for these corrections, valid along incompressible flows. We show that, in the linear regime, the infinite Chapman-Enskog series can be computed analytically, leading to universal formulas for all transport coefficients, which apply to any fluid, with any composition, with radiation of any type (also neutrinos), and with nearly any type of radiative process.

By incorporating the latest multi-messenger constraints, we impose tighter limits on the parameter space of these models and assess their consistency with observational data.

The chiral condensates are intrinsically connected to the screening masses via Ward-Takahashi identities, with the latter characterizing the inverse of the spatial correlation length in the pseudoscalar channel. Using highly improved staggered quarks, we perform simulations on lattices with temporal extents $N_\\tau = 8, 12, 16$ and an aspect ratio of 4, covering five temperatures from 145 MeV to 166 MeV. For each temperature, eight magnetic field strengths are simulated, reaching up to $eB \\sim 0.8$ GeV$^2$. These simulations allow us to provide continuum estimates for the chiral condensates and screening masses. We observe intricate behavior in the light ($ud$), strange-light ($ds$) and strange ($s$) quark condensates as functions of the magnetic field and temperature, reflecting the competition between magnetic catalysis and inverse magnetic catalysis effects. This complex behavior is also mirrored in the screening masses of the neutral pseudoscalar mesons. Notably, the screening masses of $\\pi^0$ and $K^0$ exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on $eB$, closely following the variations in their corresponding chiral condensates. Meanwhile, the screening mass of $\\eta_{s\\bar{s}}^0$ decreases monotonically with increasing $eB$. These findings provide valuable insights for understanding the behavior of QCD in a thermomagnetic medium and can serve as benchmarks for low-energy QCD models and effective theories."

However, the presence of intruder states in Cd isotopes is more pronounced. Therefore, the two-state mixing model is suitable for explaining the band mixing observed in this study. This study utilizes a simple two-state mixing model to analyze the ground and excited states of Cd isotopes. The mixing between the lowest vibrational and rotational and states and the sum of the second and third states of each are estimated and compared. The calculations indicate that the mixing is more significant in 114Cd than in 116Cd."

Subsequently, the particle spectra and collective flows for Au+Au and U+U collisions are evaluated using a hybrid hydrodynamic code CHESS. We analyze the effects of the degrees of freedom associated with the initial conditions on the final-state flow harmonics by exploring the parameter space of U+U collisions. The connection between the deformation parameters, specifically and , and the flow anisotropies is scrutinized. In particular, deviations in elliptic flow at GeV are observed at smaller values of in Au+Au collisions. In contrast, for U+U collisions, the averaged overall flow harmonics are found to be less sensitive to geometrical parameters. Despite the difference in model specifications, our findings largely confirm those obtained in previous studies employing different approaches, which indicate that flow harmonics can be used as a sensible probe for initial geometry fluctuations and to discriminate between different theoretical models."

The neutron evaporation from the fission process is considered by coupling the Weisskopf statistical model to Langevin dynamical simulation, where the potential energy surface of the respective fissioning nucleus from each fission chance is calculated using the macroscopic-microscopic model within the two-center shell model. The partitions of the charge and total excitation energy between the two complementary fragments are evaluated such that the prompt neutron emissions from fission fragments can be described based on the characteristics of primary fragments. With the present model, the calculated independent fission yields of the isotopes from Z = 30−61 in 14 MeV n+ U fission are in good agreement with the evaluated data from ENDF/B-VIII.0. Moreover, the evolution of the independent mass yields and the cumulative yields for select isotopes with the incident neutron energy, as well as the tendency of both the average TKE and prompt neutron multiplicity with the increase in the incident neutron energy, are consistent with the experimental data. The present model can aid in reproducing prompt fission observables across a range of incident neutron energies for major actinides."

      "summary": "With the discovery of a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 gigaelectronvolts (GeV) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in 2012, the Standard Model (SM) is complete, and despite intensive searches, no new fundamental particle has been observed since then. In fact, a discovery can be challenging without a predictive new physics model because different channels and observables cannot be combined directly and unambiguously. Furthermore, without supporting indirect hints, the signal space to be searched is huge, resulting in diluted significances owing to the look-elsewhere effect. Several LHC processes with multiple leptons in the final state point towards the existence of a new Higgs boson with a mass between 140 GeV to 160 GeV decaying mostly to W bosons. While the former strongly reduces the look-elsewhere effect, the latter indicates that it could be a Higgs triplet with zero hypercharge. Within this simple and predictive extension of the SM, we simulate and combine different channels of di-photon production in association with leptons, missing energy, jets, etc... Using the full run-2 results by ATLAS, including those presented recently at the Moriond conference, an increased significance of 4 standard deviations is obtained for a 152 GeV Higgs. Due to the previously predicted mass range, the look-elsewhere effect is negligible, and this constitutes the highest statistical evidence for a new narrow resonance obtained at the LHC. Furthermore, the model predicts a heavier-than-expected W boson, as indicated by the global electroweak fit. If further substantiated, the discovery of a new Higgs would overthrow the SM, provide a compelling case for the construction of future particle colliders, and pave the way to a novel understanding of the known shortcomings of the SM. In particular, the triplet Higgs field can lead to a strong first-order phase transition and could thus be related to the matter anti-matter asymmetry in our Universe."

In this paper, we utilize seven SGL systems from the TDCOSMO sample to constrain , employing the model-independent approaches: deep neural networks (DNN), Gaussian process (GP), polynomial fitting (polyfit) and Padé approximant (PA). Using these methods, we reconstruct unanchored luminosity distances from the Pantheon+ SNe Ia dataset and obtain km s−1 Mpc−1, km s−1 Mpc−1, km s−1 Mpc−1 and km s−1 Mpc−1, respectively. These estimates are consistent within 1σ level and align with local distance ladder results. Notably, the GP method achieves uncertainties that are half those of the DNN approach, whereas the DNN method offers more reliable confidence intervals in reconstruction at high redshifts. Our findings underscore the potential of these methodologies to refine constraints on and contribute to resolving the Hubble tension with future advancements."

It is suggested that the muon-catalyzed deuterium-deuterium (dd) or deuterium-tritium (dt) fusion rate, experimentally observed in liquid deuterium, increases in a PdD crystal. The main reason is that, in the palladium crystal matrix, deuterium diffuses in ionic (d+), rather than molecular (D2), form, thereby favoring the rate of (d$\\mu$d)+ formation. The slightly enhanced deuterium density and the possibly reduced muon sticking probability (compared to liquid hydrogen) point to an increase of the fusion-rate, unfortunately counterbalanced by the probability of $\\mu^-$ capture by the Pd nucleus, whose value should be evaluated by a dedicated experiment. If this mechanism were possible, we advance the hypothesis that 1989 cold fusion might have been randomly triggered by cosmic muons: an order-of-magnitude analysis shows that, under special conditions, a mW power per $\\mu^-$ might be produced. Moreover, recent experimental results showing that neutrons can sustain deuterium fusion in out-of-equilibrium conditions might explain the remaining power generation. However, reliable quantitative figures are difficult to obtain theoretically, and an experiment is suggested, to be conducted at muon-beam sources, to verify or invalidate this idea."

The model includes gluons and two-dimensional ghost fields in the adjoint representation, or ``teens''. As ghosts, the teen fields are responsible for the decrease of the pressure as $T \\rightarrow T_d$, with $T_d$ the transition temperature for deconfinement. Using the solution of this matrix model for a large number of colors, the parameters of the teen fields are adjusted so that the expectation value of the Polyakov loop is close to the values from the lattice. The shear, $\\eta$, and bulk, $\\zeta$, viscosities are computed in weak coupling but nonzero holonomy. In the pure glue theory, the value of the Polyakov loop is relatively large in the deconfined phase, $\\approx 1/2$ at $T_d$.

      "summary": "arXiv:2504.20143v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Understanding the post-merger evolution of binary neutron star merger (BNSM) requires accurate modeling of neutrino transport and microphysics including neutrino flavor conversions. Many previous studies have suggested that fast flavor instability (FFI) and collisional flavor instability (CFI) pervade inner regions of BNSM remnant, and they could impact on fluid dynamics and r-process nucleosynthesis. In this work, we re-examine prospects of occurrences of FFI and CFI using Boltzmann neutrino transport, assuming a frozen fluid background obtained from a numerical relativity simulation of BNSM. We pay special attention to a case involving a long-lived ($>1\\,$ s) hypermassive neutron star (HMNS). Apart from confirming the claim that these flavor instabilities can occur in BNSM remnants, some new insights are revealed. We identify multiple mechanisms responsible for generating electron neutrino lepton number angular crossings, corresponding to a key indicator of FFI onset, which differ notably from those in black hole (BH) accretion disk systems. We also find that the appearance of positive chemical potential of electron-type neutrinos is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for FFI, which offers a valuable diagnostic tool for predicting FFI based solely on fluid properties. For CFI, their growth rates are generally lower than FFI, but they can persistently occur in most of the accretion disk up to $\\sim 1\\,$ s. We also find that neglecting contributions of heavy-leptonic neutrinos results in overestimating growth rate and area of unstable regions of CFI. Our result suggests that FFI (CFI) tends to occur transiently (persistently) and locally (widespread in the disk), and FFI is more sensitive to the central compact object (HMNS or BH) than CFI, though more self-consistent simulations with incorporating effects of flavor conversions are needed to confirm these claims."

This duality entails that certain solutions of the wave equation (a linear theory) can be mapped to solutions of ideal relativistic hydrodynamics (an inherently nonlinear theory). Leveraging this correspondence, we explore some interesting properties of ultrastiff fluids. Specifically, we demonstrate that all nonlinear sound waves in such media are solitons. Moreover, we prove that, in 3+1 dimensions, compactly supported configurations of an ultrastiff fluid inevitably evolve, in finite time, toward a singular state where the fluid's flow velocity exits the future lightcone. We also demonstrate that, prior to the formation of this singularity, first-order perturbation theory in the small parameter $c_s^{-2}-c^{-2}$ produces divergent results. As a consequence, a fluid whose speed of sound is, say, $0.995 c$ exhibits markedly different behavior near the singularity compared to a fluid with a speed of sound exactly equal to $c$."

In this article, we study the thermoelectric coefficients of an interacting hot and dense hadron gas using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation under the relaxation time approximation. We discuss the thermoelectric properties within different frameworks of hardon resonance gas models. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the thermoelectric coefficients become anisotropic, which leads to Hall-like thermoelectric coefficients, namely Nernst coefficients, along with the magneto-Seebeck coefficients. For the first time, we also estimate the Thomson coefficient of the medium, which comes into the picture due to the temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient of the medium. In the context of studying the thermoelectric generator performance, we calculate the values of the thermoelectric figure of merit of the medium."

More than 120 general purpose equation of state tables have been contributed so far. Not all of them comply with current constraints from theoretical and experimental nuclear physics and astrophysical observations of neutron stars. Systematic investigations of the role that dense matter properties play in the evolution of these astrophysical phenomena require that more equation of state tables are provided. We build a set of general purpose equation of state tables. At zero temperature, they comply with all currently accepted constraints, including ab initio chiral effective field theory calculations of pure neutron and symmetric nuclear matter. This set is designed to explore a wide variety of the behaviors of the effective masses as functions of density, which is reflected into a wide range of thermal behaviors. We employ Brussels extended Skyrme interactions generated by means of Bayesian inference techniques. An extended nuclear statistical equilibrium model is developed for modeling sub-saturated inhomogeneous nuclear matter. We study the properties of sub-saturated inhomogeneous nuclear matter over wide ranges of density, temperature and proton fraction. We analyze the mechanisms of transition to homogeneous matter and estimate the transition density. Our key results include the presence of a think $^{14}$He layer in the inner crusts of (neo-)neutron stars, significant abundance of other exotic isotopes of H and He in warm and neutron rich matter and a detailed study of the thermodynamic stability of cold stellar matter.

Starting from an exact expression for the emission rate that fully accounts for Landau-level quantization of quarks, we derive an approximate formula applicable in the regime where quark chemical potentials are much larger than all other relevant energy scales. We demonstrate that the emission rate is largely controlled by a single dimensionless ratio between two low-energy scales: the Landau-level spacing at the Fermi surface, $|e_f B|/\\mu_{f}$, and the temperature of the quark matter, $T$. When the ratio $|e_f B|/(\\mu_{f} T)$ is small, many closely spaced Landau levels contribute to the emission. In the opposite limit, when the ratio is large, the rate is dominated by transitions between adjacent levels and is exponentially suppressed. Our results show that, even in the presence of the strongest magnetic fields expected in compact stars, the synchrotron emission remains suppressed by more than three orders of magnitude compared to the direct Urca process. This implies that such emission is unlikely to play any substantial role in the cooling of magnetized quark stars, at least those made of unpaired quark matter phases."

In Fokker-Planck dynamics, it is ensured by the Einstein relation between the drag and longitudinal momentum diffusion coefficients. However, in certain gauge field theories, this relation is violated at any nonzero heavy quark velocity. Recent work in strongly coupled $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM gauge theory shows that the Kolmogorov equation for the heavy quark phase space distribution (that reduces to Fokker-Planck form upon truncating the momentum transfer probability distribution to second moments) does equilibrate even though the Fokker-Planck equation does not. Here, we generalize some of these (to date theory-specific) insights to any quantum field theory at any coupling strength. Starting from quantum field theory first principles, we derive a universal equilibration condition for the kernel of the Kolmogorov equation and, consequently, for the momentum transfer probability distribution. Remarkably, this condition reveals that the asymmetry between energy loss and energy gain in the momentum transfer probability distribution takes a simple, theory-independent, form."

Such calculations require the evaluation of a gauge-invariant correlator of chromoelectric fields. This chromoelectric correlator encodes all the characteristics of QGP that the dissociation and recombination dynamics of quarkonium are sensitive to, which is to say can in principle measure. We review its distinctive qualitative features at weak coupling in QCD up to next-to-leading order and at strong coupling in $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM using the AdS/CFT correspondence, as well as its formulation in Euclidean QCD. Furthermore, we report on recent progress in applying our results to the calculation of the final quarkonium abundances after propagating through a cooling droplet of QGP, which illustrates how we may learn about QGP from quarkonium measurements. We devote special attention to how the presence of a strongly coupled plasma modifies the transport description of quarkonium, in comparison to approaches that rely on weak coupling approximations to describe quarkonium dissociation and recombination."

Quarks, being the electrically charged particles, can induce an electric current in the medium in response to the temperature gradients. Hence, the QGP medium can behave like a thermoelectric medium. The thermoelectric coefficients, such as the Seebeck and Thomson coefficients, can help us to understand the intricate transport phenomenon of the medium. In peripheral collisions, the intense, transient, and time-dependent magnetic field created due to spectator protons significantly influences the thermoelectric properties of the QGP medium, affecting the charge and heat transport. This work uses the quasi-particle model to calculate the Thomson coefficient in QGP. The Thomson effect, describing the continuous heating or cooling of the charge-carrying medium in the presence of temperature gradients, remains largely unexplored in QGP. The Seebeck effect, which relates temperature gradients to induced electric fields, has been widely studied in the literature. For the first time, we calculate the magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson coefficients. We have studied their dependence on temperature, baryon chemical potential, center of mass energy, and time-dependent magnetic field with different decay parameters. The transverse Thomson effect originates due to the presence of the Nernst effect in the presence of a magnetic field. Our results provide new insights into the higher-order thermoelectric transport properties of the QGP medium in the context of heavy-ion collisions."

Given the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations, the equation of state (EoS) of the neutron star (NS) matter can be constrained by the observations of NS mass, radius, and tidal deformability. However, large observational uncertainties and the limited number of observations currently make it challenging to strictly reconstruct the EoS, especially to identify interesting features such as a strong first-order phase transition. In this work, we study the dependency of reconstruction quality of the phase transition on the number of NS observations of mass and radius as well as their uncertainty, based on a fiducial EoS. We conquer this challenging problem by constructing a neural network, which allows one to parametrize the EoS with minimum model-dependency, and by devising an algorithm of parameter optimization based on the analytical linear response analysis of the TOV equations. This work may pave the way for the understanding of the phase transition features in NSs using future $x$-ray and gravitational wave measurements."

However, its applications are often plagued by the fermionic sign problem. A promising strategy is to simulate an interaction without sign problem as the zeroth order and treat the other pieces as perturbations. According to this scheme, we construct precision nuclear chiral forces on the lattice and make perturbative calculations around a sign-problem-free interaction respecting the Wigner-SU(4) symmetry. We employ the recently developed perturbative QMC (ptQMC) method to calculate the perturbative energies up to the second order. This work presents the first ptQMC calculations for two-body next-to-next-to-next-to leading order (N$^3$LO) chiral forces and elucidates how the hierarchical nature of the chiral interactions helps organize and simplify the ptQMC calculations. We benchmark the algorithm for the deuteron, where exact solutions serve as rigorous reference points. We also reproduce the famous Tjon line by correlating the perturbative $^{4}$He binding energies with the non-perturbative $^{3}$H binding energies. These comprehensive demonstrations underscore the efficacy of ptQMC in resolving high-fidelity nuclear interactions, establishing its potential as a robust tool for \\textit{ab initio} nuclear structure studies."

Using our numerical solver, we simulate the transport of heavy quark test particles in an SU(3) glasma background field. The glasma field equations are formulated using classical real-time lattice gauge theory, and the heavy quark dynamics are described by classical transport equations numerically solved using the colored particle-in-cell method. For the first time, the effect of the glasma stage on the azimuthal correlations of $c\\overline{c}$ and $b\\overline{b}$ pairs is studied. The resulting azimuthal width $\\sigma_{\\Delta\\phi}$ exhibits a large and quick decorrelation due to the strong glasma fields. Further, we evaluate how the $p_T$-broadening in the glasma affects heavy quark $p_T$-spectra, which are initialized according to the Fixed-Order Next-to-Leading Logarithm (FONLL) heavy quark production calculation. The nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ is extracted for $c$ and $b$ quarks in the glasma and additional nuclear PDF effects accounting for gluon shadowing are included."

While the three states can be interpreted as $\\Sigma_c\\bar{D}^{(*)}$ molecular states within EFT frameworks, this is not feasible in the single-channel OBE model with consistent cutoff. In this work, the possibility to reconcile OBE model with EFTs by refitting the $\\rho$-, $\\omega$- and $\\sigma$-exchange interaction is explored and ruled out. It is pointed out that the problem in OBE arises from the strong short-range spin-dependent one-pion-exchange (OPE) interaction and the fixed signs of other short-range interactions in OBE model also prevent the cancellation. To address this issue, the short-range subtraction strategies within the OBE model are revisited. Two subtraction schemes are explored: removing the delta-function from all interactions and eliminating it only from the pseudoscalar-meson-exchange component. These schemes favor different spin assignments for $P_{c\\bar{c}}(4440)$ and $P_{c\\bar{c}}(4457)$. Though solving the problem, there is no clear dynamical picture to support the subtraction schemes. We propose a new quark-exchange mechanism motivated by the Pauli principle. Different from the two subtraction schemes in OBE, the quark-exchange mechanism offers an explanation grounded in microscopic dynamics. It is shown that the spin-dependent quark-exchange interaction cancels those from OPE. The differences in the predictions for the spin, isospin, and open-charm partner states of the experimental $P_{c\\bar{c}}$ states offer a way to distinguish between the subtracted OBE model and the OBE model with quark-exchange contributions."

We assess the performance of these QMF models in describing the mass-radius relation, the cooling evolution of isolated NSs and X-ray transients, and the instabilities (e.g., the r-mode). In comparison to relativistic mean field (RMF) models formulated at the hadronic level, the QMF model predicts heavier nuclear clusters and larger Wigner-Seitz cell sizes in the NS crust, while the density of the free neutron gas remains largely similar between the two approaches. For the cooling of isolated NSs, the thermal evolution is found to be insensitive to both the many-body model and the symmetry energy slope in the absence of the direct Urca (dUrca) process. However, when rapid cooling via the dUrca process is allowed, in the case of large $L_0$ values (e.g., $L_0 \\gtrsim 80$ MeV) in our study, the QMF model predicts a longer thermal relaxation time. Both the QMF and RMF models can reproduce cooling curves consistent with observations of X-ray transients (e.g., KS 1731--260) during their crustal cooling phase, although stellar parameters show slight variations depending on the model and symmetry energy slope. Within our unified framework, a larger $L_0$ value generally results in a wider instability window, while increasing the stellar mass tends to suppress the instability window. We also provide simple power-law parameterizations that quantify the dependence of bulk and shear viscosities on the symmetry energy slope for nuclear matter at saturation density."

In the $s$-channel diagrams, scalar and tensor mesons are incorporated, specifically $f_0(2020,2100,2200)$ and $f_2(1950,2010,2150)$, respectively, along with the pseudoscalar meson $\\eta(2225)$. Our calculations suggest that contributions from the $N$ and $N^*$ resonances significantly enhance the cross-section near the threshold. At the same time, those from the $f_0$ and $f_2$ mesons produce distinctive peak structures around $W=2.2$ GeV, qualitatively reproducing the JETSET experimental data. The openings of the $\\bar{\\Lambda}\\Lambda$ and $\\bar{\\Sigma}\\Sigma$ channels lead to the cusp structures, which can explain the nontrivial structures in the cross-section at $W\\approx2M_{\\Lambda}$ and $2M_{\\Sigma}$ observed in the data. It turns out that contributions from the $\\eta$ and $P_s$ resonances are almost negligible. Additionally, polarization observables such as the spin density matrix element (SDME) provide crucial insights into the individual hadronic processes involved in this reaction."

Specifically, we compare four hadronization scenarios: (i) the default popcorn mechanism, which permits extended string configurations with intermediate meson formation between baryon-antibaryon pairs; (ii) a diquark scenario utilizing a QCD-based color reconnection scheme (CR1) designed to minimize string lengths, thereby restricting baryon production exclusively to baryon-antibaryon pairs; (iii) a junction-based scenario where baryon number is carried by non-perturbative QCD string junctions; and (iv) a thermal model featuring string tension fluctuations, leading to a thermal-like transverse momentum distribution. Our results indicate that the default popcorn approach inadequately describes proton stopping and hadron distributions at mid-rapidity, especially at lower collision energies. In contrast, the diquark scenario significantly enhances the accuracy of proton rapidity distributions, while the thermal model further improves the reproduction of pion spectra at lower transverse momenta and captures essential features of strangeness production, specifically suppressing K− at central rapidity (y < 1) and enhancing K+ yields. Conversely, the junction-based scenario provides no substantial improvement at higher SPS energies. These findings underscore the necessity of refined hadronization descriptions for accurately modeling particle production at SPS energies."

Our analysis reveals that the shadow characteristics of M87* and Sgr A* are more compatible with event horizon telescope (EHT) observational data in nonhomogeneous plasma spacetime than in homogeneous plasma spacetime. For a small metric deformation parameter , the shadow aligns within uncertainty for homogeneous plasma and within for nonhomogeneous plasma.

For global nuclear calculations, density functional theories (DFTs) have been developed to reduce the complexity and computational cost required in describing nuclear systems. However, DFT often makes approximations and assumptions about terms included in the functional, which may introduce systematic uncertainties compared to microscopic calculations using EFTs. In this work, we investigate possible avenues of improving nuclear DFT using nonlinear relativistic mean-field (RMF) theory. We explore the impact of RMF model extensions by fitting the nonlinear RMF model to predictions of nuclear matter and selected closed-shell nuclei using four successful chiral EFT Hamiltonians. We find that these model extensions are impactful and important in capturing the physics present within chiral Hamiltonians, particularly for charge radii and neutron skins of closed-shell nuclei. However, there are additional effects that are not captured within the RMF model, particularly within the isoscalar sector of RMF theory. Additional model extensions and the reliability of the nonlinear RMF model are discussed."

Across three representative astrophysical scenarios, both approaches yield nearly identical mass-radius relations, density-pressure relations, and overlapping 95.4\\% confidence level regions. We find significant variations in the predicted distributions of nuclear characteristics at nuclear saturation in the isoscalar channel, e.g., in nuclear compressibility $K_{\\rm sat}$, whereas the isovector quantities, for example, proton fraction, are quite similar. Our results indicate that the influence of individual nuclear characteristics at saturation density on the global properties of compact stars is obscured by the integral nature of these quantities. This, in turn, underscores the need for dedicated nuclear experiments sensitive to these characteristics in order to better constrain their values."

In this paper we calculate the electron capture rates on isotopes of chromium with mass range $42\\leq A \\leq 65$, including neutron-deficient and neutron-rich isotopes.

Pre-neutron emission distributions, essential for fission fragment evaporation codes like \\cgmf{}, are extracted from distributions that are always measured after neutron emission, as the time scale of the emission of prompt fission neutrons is too short for direct measurement before the emission. However, obtaining accurate pre-neutron emission distributions requires methods that eliminate the effects of mass resolution and detector efficiency. We propose a deblurring technique based on the Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm, commonly used in optics for image restoration, to correct for these experimental effects. The RL algorithm uses the measured mass distributions and a transfer matrix to perform iterative deconvolution. The advantage of this method over others is that it does not assume any predefined shape such as a sum of Gaussians, as in \\cgmf{}, for the distributions. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the fission fragment mass distributions measured in the spontaneous fission of $^{252}$Cf to extract pre-neutron emission fission fragment mass distributions. The results from deblurring are then used as inputs to \\cgmf{}, and we compare the \\cgmf{} results obtained using deblurring inputs with the default \\cgmf{} results."

We implement this ansatz in the Hybrid Strong/Weak Coupling Model.

Current measurements at RHIC and the LHC observe a significant suppression in the per-trigger yield at forward rapidities compared to that in proton-proton collisions, nominally consistent with the \"mono-jet\" production expected in a saturation scenario.

The emergent CSS equation takes the form of a rate equation describing the evolution of the dijet distribution in the transverse momentum imbalance $K_\\perp$ when increasing the dijet relative momentum $P_\\perp$. All three types of evolution become important when both $P_\\perp$ and $K_\\perp$ are much larger than the nuclear saturation momentum $Q_s(x)$ and we propose a framework which encompasses all of them. The solution to the JIMWLK equation provides the source term for the DGLAP evolution with increasing $K_\\perp$, which in turn generates the initial condition for the CSS evolution with increasing $P_\\perp$."

      "summary": "We have studied the charge and the heat transport properties of a hot and dense QCD matter by solving the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation using a novel approximation method. Following the recently developed novel relaxation time approximation (RTA) model, we have proposed a novel Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK) model with a modified collision integral to carry out the aforementioned study. We have also compared our findings with the results of the novel RTA, the standard RTA and the standard BGK models. Our observation shows that the novel collision integrals for both the RTA and BGK models decrease the charge and the heat transport phenomena in the medium, as evidenced by the reduced values of the transport coefficients, such as the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity, when compared to the standard RTA and standard BGK models. Furthermore, certain observables associated with the abovementioned transport coefficients, such as the thermal diffusion constant and the Lorenz number have been explored using the novel approaches of the aforesaid models. We have found an overall decreasing trend of the thermal diffusion constant with the temperature in the novel BGK model, similar to the novel RTA model, but the magnitude remains higher throughout the temperature range. However, the magnitude of the thermal diffusion constant in the proposed novel BGK model remains conspicuously lower than its value in the standard BGK model. The magnitude of the Lorenz number in the novel BGK model remains significantly higher than that in the standard BGK model, but it is lower than that in the novel RTA model. We have also observed that the Lorenz number in all cases has an increasing trend at low temperatures, showing a violation of the Wiedemann–Franz law, whereas at high temperatures, it becomes saturated. The Lorenz number remaining above unity indicates that the thermal conductivity prevails over the electrical conductivity in the aforesaid models."

Using event-shape observables, one can constrain the probability distributions of anisotropic flow coefficients, thus reducing the linear and nonlinear contributions in the measured higher-order harmonics. In this paper, we use transverse spherocity as an event shape observable to study the flow coefficients and elliptic flow fluctuations. Transverse spherocity is found to have a strong correlation with elliptic flow and its fluctuations. We exploit this feature of transverse spherocity to remove the contribution of elliptic flow from higher-order harmonics. The study is performed in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV using a multi-phase transport model. The multi-particle Q-cumulant method estimates the anisotropic flow coefficients, which reduces the non-flow contributions.

By applying a second-order expansion of the statistical operator in hydrodynamic gradients, we show that new second-order terms arise from the coupling of two-point quantum correlators between tensors of different ranks evaluated at distinct space-time points. These terms emerge due to the presence of the acceleration vector in the system, which enables the generalization of Curie's theorem-based symmetry constraints for constructing invariants from tensors of different ranks at separate space-time locations. In a generic quantum system described by the energy-momentum tensor, multiple conserved charges, and spin tensors, we identify these new terms within a complete set of second-order equations governing the shear-stress tensor, bulk-viscous pressure, charge-diffusion currents, rotational stress tensor, and boost-heat vector. Furthermore, we express all transport coefficients in the theory represented by two-point or three-point correlation functions as retarded Green's functions."

We have developed a unified framework for jet and bulk medium evolution within a multiphase transport approach where the jets and medium share energy and momentum via multiple elastic scatterings and medium-induced gluon radiation during the parton transport. The formulation enables realistic predictions of jet based observables extended to a large radius of the jet cone in central Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV. The model provides reasonable quantitative agreement with the experimental data from inclusive jet suppression and the full jet shape function up to large radial distances induced by both the collisional and radiative jet energy loss and migration of the lost $p_T$ in the medium. We find that gradual degradation of jet energy through gluon emissions alters the energy-momentum evolution in the jet, essential to describe the entire range of jet shape ratio relative to proton-proton collisions. Pure collisional energy loss injects appreciable $p_T$ broadening and migration of the medium partons, resulting in an enhanced population at large angular distances in the jet-shape ratio."

This follows from the holographic duality between a spinning fluid in ten dimensions and an anomalous chiral fluid in four dimensions. We comment on the relations between the theory of spin hydrodynamics introduced here and other theories of spin hydrodynamics in the context of heavy-ion collisions."

The non-perturbative formulation based on the exact WKB method works for incorporating both the Zel'dovich regularization and the complex scaling method. While previous studies have demonstrated the exact WKB analysis in bound state problems, our work extends its application to quasi-stationary states. By examining the inverted Rosen-Morse potential, we illustrate how the exact WKB analysis captures resonant phenomena in a rigorous manner. We explore the equivalence and complementarity of different well-established regularizations \\`a la Zel'dovich and complex scaling within this framework. This offers a deeper understanding of resonant states and their analytic structures. Our results provide a concrete demonstration of the non-perturbative accuracy of exact WKB methods in unstable quantum systems."

They suggest that the commonly used form of the local equilibrium Wigner function should be replaced by a new expression. The latter fulfills the necessary condition for the normalization of the mean spin polarization, which the former fails to reproduce. Moreover, the new form of the local equilibrium Wigner function leads to generalized thermodynamic relations for perfect spin hydrodynamics, which were found before in the approach using the classical concept of spin. The forms of the conserved tensors obtained with the new Wigner function agree with those obtained with the classical spin method up to the second order in the spin polarization tensor; however, they disagree, as expected, for large values of the mean polarization."

The specific calculations for 6,7Li and 7Be nuclei indicate that the conventional impulse approximation can be applied to the electron-nucleus scattering only when the incident electron energy does not exceed twice the nucleon mass. In addition, the quasi-elastic scattering cross section of 7Li in the excitation from its ground state to the nearest excited state and that of elastic scattering in the ground state are independently treated, whereas they have not been separately measured in experiments. The obtained scattering cross sections corresponding to an appropriate adjustment of the harmonic oscillator parameter along with the V-A structure interpret reasonably well the available experimental data at MeV energies and provide predictive information at GeV energies. This gives new perspectives in studying the structure of nuclei and the weak interactions via electron or lepton scattering at high (GeV) energies, considering nuclei rather than quarks."

      "summary": "arXiv:2411.04244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The highly energetic particle medium formed in the ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision displays a notable difference in the temperatures between its central and peripheral regions. This temperature gradient can generate an electric field within the medium, a phenomenon referred to as the Seebeck effect. We have estimated the Seebeck coefficient for a dense quark-gluon plasma medium by using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in the recently developed novel relaxation time approximation (RTA) model within the kinetic theory framework. This study explores the Seebeck coefficient of individual quark flavors as well as the entire partonic medium. Our observation indicates that, for given current quark masses, the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient for each quark flavor as well as for the partonic medium decreases as the temperature rises and increases as the chemical potential increases. Furthermore, we have investigated the Seebeck effect by considering the partonic interactions within the quasiparticle model. In addition, we have presented a comparison between our findings and the results of the standard RTA model. We have observed that the Seebeck coefficient of the QGP medium gets conspicuously decreased in the novel RTA model as compared to that in the standard RTA model. A decreased Seebeck coefficient in the novel RTA model describes a smaller magnitude of induced electric field in the medium than that estimated by the standard RTA model. However, the rate of decline gets gradually smaller as the medium gets hotter for both the current quark mass scenario and the quasiparticle mass scenario. It is also found that, in the noninteracting case, the Seebeck coefficient possesses a slightly negative value in the high temperature region, unlike the quasiparticle description, where the Seebeck coefficient remains positive for the entire temperature range."

This transport peak leads to a power-law $t^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ decay of the symmetric correlator at late time, also known as the long-time tail, as well as diffusion-like spreading in position space.

It is observed that in typically selected stiff and soft relativistic mean-field (RMF) models, zero-sound modes arise at low temperature, whereas increasing the temperature gradually breaks the zero sound in soft models, with a smaller density range compared to stiff models. At high density, the presence or absence of zero sound turns out to be correspondingly the character of the stiff or soft RMF EOS. More strikingly, we find by analyzing the dispersion relation and sound velocity that at finite temperature the zero-sound modes in RMF models with the stiff EOS undergo a thermal bifurcation, resulting in the transform of zero sound into the first sound at some momentum $Q>T$. The thermally bifurcated sound branch in the stiff models and the zero-sound branch in the soft models are both highly sensitive to the slope of the symmetry energy, providing promising signals for the pending high-density symmetry energies. In addition, it is found that there exists a nonlinear dispersion relation for both the stiff and soft models that supports the zero sound in the relatively lower density region."

The first-forbidden (FF) transition becomes important, in the circumstances where allowed Gamow-Teller (GT) transitions are unfavored, specifically for neutron-rich nuclei due to phase space considerations. In this paper deformed proton-neutron quasi-particle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA) model is applied, for the first time, for the estimation of allowed GT and unique first-forbidden (U1F) transitions ($|\\Delta$J$|$ = 2) of neutron rich copper isotopes in mass range 72 $\\leq$ A $\\leq$ 82 under stellar conditions. We compared our computed terrestrial $\\beta$-decay half-life values with previous calculations and experimental results. It was concluded that the pn-QRPA calculation is in good accordance with measured data. Our study suggests that the addition of rank (0 and 1) operators in FF transitions can further improve the comparison which remain unattended at this stage. The deformed pn-QRPA model was employed for the estimation of GT and U1F stellar electron emission ($\\beta$$^{-}$-decay) rates over wide range of stellar temperature (0.01 GK -- 30 GK) and density (10 -- 10$^{11}$ g/cm$^{3}$) domains for astrophysical applications. Our study shows that, in high density and low temperature regions, the contribution of U1F rates to total electron emission rates of neutron-rich copper nuclei is negligible."

The fate of the massive stars is decided by these weak-decay rates including lepton (positron and electron) captures rates, which play a consequential role in the dynamics of core collapse. As per previous simulation results, weak interaction rates on nickel isotopes have significant influence on the stellar core vis-$\\grave{a}$-vis controlling the lepton content of stellar matter throughout the silicon shell burning phases of high mass stars up to the presupernova stages. In this paper we perform a microscopic calculation of Gamow-Teller charge-changing transitions, in the $\\beta$-decay and electron capture directions, for neutron-rich nickel isotopes ($^{66-71}$Ni). We further compute the associated weak-decay rates for these selected nickel isotopes in stellar environment. The computations are accomplished by employing the deformed proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA) model. A recent study showed that the deformed pn-QRPA theory is well suited for the estimation of Gamow-Teller transitions. The astral weak-decay rates are determined over densities in the range of 10 -- 10$^{11}$g/cm$^{3}$ and temperatures in the range of 0.01$\\times$10$^{9}$ -- 30$\\times$10$^{9}$K. The calculated lepton capture rates are compared with the previous calculation of Pruet and Fuller. The overall comparison demonstrates that, at low stellar densities and high temperatures, our electron captures rates are bigger by as much as two orders of magnitude. Our results show that, at higher temperatures, the lepton capture rates are the dominant mode for the stellar weak rates and the corresponding lepton emission rates may be neglected."

In this work, we investigate the transport properties of quark matter under finite rotation, focusing specifically on electrical conductivity and shear viscosity by using a two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. The chiral condensate in the NJL model decreases under rotation, leading to enhanced transport properties. Moreover, rotation induces anisotropy in the transport coefficients, which are calculated within the kinetic theory framework using the Boltzmann transport equation. The Coriolis force is introduced in the force term of the Boltzmann transport equation, like the Lorentz force, which is considered for finite magnetic fields. By using a phenomenological temperature-dependent angular velocity, we observe that the variation of anisotropic components with temperature preserves the traditional valley-shaped pattern. However, the magnitude of the anisotropic components is suppressed compared to the usual component one finds in the absence of rotation. Interestingly, at zero net quark density, Hall-like transport phenomena emerge as significant non-dissipative contributions under rotation, which is not expected under finite magnetic fields due to the cancellation of quark and anti-quark Hall currents."

This implies that the expectation values of the net color charge in any region of any physical state in QCD, states that satisfy the color Gauss law, are automatically zero for all components of color. In this paper it is shown that the expectation value of the square of the net color charge in a region, a measure of the color charge fluctuations, is necessarily nonzero when evaluated in physical states and the result, while depending on the scheme and scale by which the theory is regulated, is gauge invariant. This holds despite the formal lack of gauge invariance of the operator.

The method that we adopt is based on determining an optimal separation of the Hamiltonian into a stabilizer component and a residual part inducing non-stabilizerness. The corresponding stabilizer ground state is efficiently prepared using techniques of graph states and stabilizer tableaux. We demonstrate this technique in context of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, a fully-connected spin system presenting a second order phase transition from spherical to deformed state. The resulting stabilizer ground state is found to capture to a large extent both bi-partite and collective multi-partite entanglement features of the exact solution in the region of large deformation. We also explore several methods for injecting non-stabilizerness into the system, including ADAPT-VQE, and imaginary-time evolution (ITE) techniques. Stabilizer ground states are found to accelerate ITE convergence due to a larger overlap with the exact ground state. This study motivates applications of the proposed approach to more realistic quantum many-body systems, whose stabilizer ground states can be used in combinations with powerful classical many-body techniques and/or quantum methods."

In this work, evidence for inelastic particle production is observed in one-dimensional Ising field theory using IBM's quantum computers.

This method efficiently prepares wavepackets by extending recent protocols for creating W states with mid-circuit measurement and feedforward. The required circuit depth is independent of wavepacket size and spatial dimension, representing a superexponential improvement over previous methods.

Recent multi-messenger observations, including gravitational waves from neutron star mergers and precise X-ray data from NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) mission, have significantly constrained the neutron star equation of state (EOS). This study investigates the effects of phase transitions in neutron stars, focusing on NICER's latest observation of PSR J0437--4715. We employ Bayesian inference techniques to evaluate the presence of first-order phase transitions using a piecewise polytropic EOS model. Our analysis incorporates data from multiple NICER sources, to refine constraints on key phase transition parameters, including critical density and transition depth. We find that including data from PSR J0437--4715 improves the evidence of phase transitions and tightens the EOS constraints, especially at higher densities. However, Bayes factor analysis only indicates a slight preference for models without phase transitions and current observational precision is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In particular, this polytropic model identifies the critical phase transition mass of neutron stars as being close to 1.4 solar masses, which coincides with the approximate mass range of PSR J0437--4715. This work emphasizes the importance of precise measurements of PSR J0437--4715 for deepening our understanding of neutron star interiors and exploring potential new physics at extreme densities."

Hence in this study, we explore this effect, emphasizing the dominant role of electric fields in the charge splitting of elliptic flow, Δv2, as a function of transverse momentum (pT). The velocity and temperature profiles of quark-gluon plasma medium is described through thermal model calculations. The electromagnetic field evolution is however determined from the solutions of Maxwell’s equations, assuming constant electric and chiral conductivities. We find that the slower decay of the electric fields compared to the magnetic fields makes its impact on the splitting of the elliptic flow more dominant.

Such inverse problems typically involve large uncertainties, both in the measurement parameters being inverted and in the underlying physics models themselves. Monte Carlo sampling, when combined with modern non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques such as autoencoders and manifold learning, can be used to reduce the size of the parameter spaces considerably. However, there is no guarantee that the resulting combinations of parameters will be physically valid, or even mathematically consistent. In this position paper, we advocate adopting a hybrid approach that leverages our recent advances in the development of formal verification methods for numerical algorithms, with the goal of constructing parameter space restrictions with provable mathematical and physical correctness properties, whilst nevertheless respecting both experimental uncertainties and uncertainties in the underlying physical processes."

Yet, it remains challenging due to the dielectric transparency and metal loss in optical and near-infrared regimes. Here, we present a rotated hexagonal air cavity embedded in an Ag-air-Ag waveguide. Under near-infrared excitation, evanescent waves tunnel into the cavity. In addition to the whispering gallery mode and surface plasmon polaritons, the cavity also induces Fabry-P\\'erot (FP) resonance, whose orientation is tunable via cavity rotation. Thus, our cavity possesses much stronger field confinement and higher Q than a circular cavity lacking FP resonance. The waveguide exhibits suppressed backward reflection filtering and Fano-type lineshapes. Then, integrating a silicon cylinder into the cavity, we demonstrate linear tuning of Mie resonances via radius adjustment. When the electric dipole (ED) resonance is excited, energy is predominantly confined within the cylinder. Different Mie modes will change the orientation of the FP resonance. Furthermore, the hybrid modes with ED resonance induce the third-harmonic wave of green light. These findings offer a promising strategy for designing high-Q air cavities for next-generation multifunctional electro-optical devices."

One intriguing feature of massive transport is the coupling of the secular equations between the sound and heat channels. This coupling vanishes as the mass approaches zero. By utilizing the argument principle in complex analysis, we determine the existence condition for collective modes and find the onset transition behavior of collective modes previously observed in massless systems. We numerically determine the critical wavenumber for the existence of each mode under various values of the scaled mass. Within the range of scaled masses considered, the critical wavenumbers for the heat and shear channels decrease with increasing scaled mass, while that of the sound channel exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the scaled mass. In addition, we analytically derive the dispersion relations for these collective modes in the long-wavelength limit. Notably, kinetic theory also incorporates collisionless dissipation effects, known as Landau damping. We find that the branch cut structure responsible for Landau damping differs significantly from the massless case: whereas the massless system features only two branch points, the massive system exhibits an infinite number of such points forming a continuous branch cut."

In neutron-rich nuclei, a core$+n$ structure can compete with nuclear deformation due to the small neutron separation energy. A neutron-rich carbon isotope, $^{17}$C, exemplifies the appearance of the deformation and the core+$n$ decoupling in its spectrum, which is desirable for a deeper understanding of the coexistence phenomena in neutron-rich nuclei. We aim to describe and understand this coexistence phenomenon in the low-lying levels of $^{17}$C in a unified manner considering explicitly the degrees of freedom of both the quadrupole deformation and the relative motion between a $^{16}$C core and a valence neutron. We adopt the generator coordinate method (GCM) with the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) to describe various configurations. We superpose various basis wave functions generated by the energy variation by imposing two types of constraints: one incorporating the degree of the quadrupole deformation and the other taking care of the relative motion between a $^{16}$C core and a valence neutron. We find that the experimental energy level is well reproduced by the present method, including both deformed and $^{16}$C+$n$ configurations. The ground $3/2^{+}$ and second excited $5/2^{+}$ states exhibit a triaxially deformed shape, while the main component of the first excited $1/2^{+}$ state is a $^{16}$C($0^{+}$) core plus an $s$-wave neutron configuration. The tail of the valence neutron is significantly improved by including the $^{16}$C+$n$ basis functions explicitly. The explicit inclusion of both the quadrupole deformation and the relative motion between a core and a valence neutron is essential to describe the coexistence phenomena observed in neutron-rich nuclei in the AMD+GCM framework."

Among these, frameworks utilizing CDFs with density-dependent meson-nucleon couplings furnishing the equation of state (EoS) of compact star (CS) matter have been explored. [Purpose] The aforementioned inference framework has not yet incorporated astrophysical objects with potentially extreme high masses or ultra-small radii among its constraints, leaving its flexibility and predictive power under such extreme parameters still unknown. [Method] We apply the Bayesian inference framework based on CDFs with density dependent couplings. The astrophysical data is expanded to include not only the latest multi-messenger constraints from NICER and gravitational wave events but also the highest measured mass to date for the ``black widow\" pulsar PSR J0952-0607 and the mass-radius estimates for the ultra-compact, low-mass object HESS J1731-347. [Results] Our systematic Bayesian analysis indicates that our CDF models can support higher maximum masses for CSs, reaching up to $2.4$-$2.5\\,M_{\\odot}$. However, achieving sufficient softening of the EoS in the low-density regime to accommodate the HESS J1731-347 data remains challenging. Nonetheless, we are able to impose tighter constraints on the parameter space of CDF models, ensuring consistency with current nuclear experimental and astrophysical data. [Conclusions] CDF models with density-dependent meson-nucleon couplings encompass a wide range of nuclear and astrophysical phenomena, providing a robust theoretical framework for interpreting compact objects. However, the predicted lower limit for the radii of low-mass stars is approximately 12 km, which stems from the restricted degrees of freedom in the isovector sector."

In this work, we present a quantum annealing protocol to obtain nuclear ground states. We propose a tailored driver Hamiltonian that preserves a large gap and validate our approach in a dozen nuclei with basis sizes up to $10^5$ using classical simulations of the annealing evolution. We explore the relation between the spectral gap and the total time of the annealing protocol, assessing its accuracy by comparing the fidelity and energy relative error to classical benchmarks. While the nuclear Hamiltonian is non-local and thus challenging to implement in current setups, the estimated computational cost of our annealing protocol on quantum circuits is polynomial in the single particle basis size, paving the way to study heavier nuclei."

We consider the light diquarks with spin-parity $J^P=0^\\pm$ and $1^\\pm$. Medium corrections to the SHBs are provided through the diquarks whereas the heavy quark is simply regarded as a spectator. The chiral dynamics of the diquark are described by the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model having (pseudo)scalar-type and (axial)vector-type four-point interactions and the six-point ones responsible for the $U(1)_A$ axial anomaly. The divergences are handled by means of the three-dimensional proper-time regularization with both ultraviolet and infrared cutoffs included, in order to eliminate unphysical imaginary parts. As a result, the mass degeneracies between the parity partners of all the SHBs are predicted in accordance with the chiral restoration. In particular, the HQS-doublet SHBs exhibit clear mass degeneracies due to the absence of the direct anomaly effects. We also predict a mass degeneracy of $\\Sigma_c$ and $\\Omega_c$ above the pseudocritical temperature $T_{\\rm pc}$ of chiral restoration, which results in a peculiar mass hierarchy for positive-parity HQS-doublet SHBs where $\\Xi_c'$ becomes heavier than $\\Omega_c$ Besides, it is found that the decay width of $\\Sigma_c\\to\\Lambda_c\\pi$ vanishes above $T_{\\rm pc}$ reflecting a closing of the threshold.

There are 171 cases are presented in model-dependent forms, including the modified Harmonic-oscillator function, two-parameter Femi function (2pF), three-parameter Femi function, three-parameter Gaussian function, and 97 in Fourier-Bessel series model-independent forms. Independent of density functions, the point-proton root-mean-square (rms) radii of the derived point-proton density show excellent agreement with each other. We identify cases where the tabulated data of charge densities and charge radii are inconsistent, and the deduced point-proton density distributions are inaccurate due to insufficient experimental momentum transfer coverage or inconsistent scattering experiments. For the widely used 2pF distribution, it is found that the surface diffuseness parameters can be empirically calculated from those of charge density, while the half-density radius parameters follow the $A^{1/3}$ rule. The derived point-proton density distributions can be used as input in nuclear reaction studies and compared with nuclear model predictions."

Previous theoretical studies predicted 16O + 2$\\alpha$ condensed states. However, in those studies, the strong mixing with non-resonant states made the identification of true resonant states non-trivial. Purpose: To address this issue, we aim to provide a more robust theoretical verification of the 16O + 2$\\alpha$ condensation. Our goal is to clearly identify the resonant states and predict their properties, such as decay widths. Method: We employ the real-time evolution method (REM), which generates physically important basis states using the equation of motion, minimizing contamination from the continuum. The analytical continuation in the coupling constant (ACCC) was used to estimate the $\\alpha$-decay widths. Results: The present calculations show much better convergence of eigenstates, and the $0^+_3$ and $0^+_4$ states showed remarkable isoscalar monopole transition strengths, which were in good agreement with the predictions of Ichikawa et al. The small alpha-decay widths for these states suggest that experimental observation appears feasible. Conclusion: The present results show the reasonable agreement with a previous work, firmly establishing the $0^+_3$ and $0^+_4$ states approximately 5 and 1 MeV below the 16O + 2$\\alpha$ threshold as candidates for the 2$\\alpha$ condensation around the core nucleus 16O. The REM proved effective in identifying these states."

While hadronic models characterize nucleonic matter, potentially including contributions from hyperons or mesons, hybrid models introduce phase transitions to quark matter, and quark models hypothesize the presence of deconfined quark matter cores or entirely quark-composed stars.

Generically, one encounters correlation functions of multiple currents which must satisfy Ward identities. At intermediate steps, however the Ward identities are obscured, and often violated by physically motivated approximation schemes. In this paper we outline a method to construct a representation of the aforementioned correlators that manifests gauge invariance in the limit of a heavy target (i.e., when recoil energy can be neglected). This representation then enables manifestly gauge invariant approximation schemes. Furthermore, the proposed representation naturally separates the largest contributions that dominate scattering amplitudes in the limit of a heavy constituent (e.g., proton) mass. We analyze elastic electron scattering from nuclei in detail, and also discuss radiative corrections to processes mediated by the weak interaction."

In a simplified single-channel setting, we derive the conditions under which the infinite-volume integral equations from the RFT and BRH approaches reduce to the LS form.

Using the all-orders correlation potential method, including Breit and radiative quantum electrodynamics corrections, we perform high-accuracy calculations of electric-dipole (E1), electric-quadrupole (E2), and magnetic-dipole (M1) transition matrix elements between the low-lying s, p, and d states of these ions, as well as the excited-state lifetimes, polarizabilities, magic wavelengths, and magnetic dipole (A) hyperfine structure constants.

By combining hyperfine measurements with atomic theory, we extract parameters of the nuclear magnetisation distribution (the Bohr-Weisskopf effect) for 135-, 137-Ba and 223-, 225-Ra.

Analysis for pairs of pions is most common, due to their large abundance in the collisions, as well as well-understood theoretical formalism and advanced experimental methodology. It is usually performed in three dimensions in longitudinally co-moving reference frame of the pair, to maximize the amount of information obtained about the source. Similar three-dimensional analysis has also been performed for charged and neutral kaons. In contrast analyses for all other pair types -- either for pairs of identical protons, or for pairs of non-identical particles are only one-dimensional. The abundance of heavier particles is lower than for pions, while the theoretical formalism for such correlations, as well as practical experimental methodology is limited to one-dimensional case up to now. This work identifies specific challenges arising in the analysis of three-dimensional proton-proton femtoscopy and proposes a theoretical formalism to analyze them, as well as specific experimental methods to extract and fit correlations. A test and validation of these methods is performed on correlations simulated in the LHyquid+Therminator2 model, and demonstrates the feasibility of such analysis. The caveats in the theoretical interpretation of the results are discussed, by comparing the fitted values of femtscopic radii with the true characteristics of the source extracted directly from the model."

      "summary": "arXiv:2505.05429v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Quasi-universal relations are known to exist among various neutron star observables that do not depend sensitively on the underlying nuclear matter equations of state. For example, some of these relations imply that the tidally induced multipole moments are approximately characterized by the electric-type quadrupolar tidal deformability. Such relations can be used to reduce the number of independent tidal parameters in gravitational-waveform modeling, thereby allowing us to infer extreme nuclear matter properties more accurately and test General Relativity in an insensitive manner to uncertainties in nuclear physics. We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation into approximate universality of neutron stars. Our approach employs a semi-analytic relativistic stellar interior model, which extends the Tolman VII solution, thereby enabling a refined exploration of the tidal properties of nonrotating stars within a semi-analytic framework. The derived power-law relations among various tidal deformabilities -- referred to as the universal Love relations -- agree well with expressions in previous work found empirically. We elucidate how the equation-of-state dependence is suppressed in a particular combination of macroscopic physical parameters induced by perturbations and demonstrate that the relation between the moment of inertia and electric-type quadrupolar tidal deformability (I-Love relation) rests on the same underlying mechanism. Our findings indicate that the approximate universality of neutron stars can be attributed to low compressibility, consistent with some of the previous studies on the possible origin of the universality."

We argue that besides primordial black holes also droplet-like quark-gluon plasma inhomogeneities may become gravitationally stabilized for a sufficiently long epoch to distill baryon number and form nuclear matter droplets which upon their evaporation may enrich the cosmos locally with heavy $r$-process elements already in the early Universe."

The methods described in this paper constitute tools that can be used to investigate the properties of scalar functions used to define nuclear potentials and quantify their contribution to the uncertainty of few nucleon calculations. We demonstrate these methods in deuteron bound state and nucleon - nucleon scattering calculations. Backpropagation, implemented in the Python pytorch library, is used to calculate the gradients with respect to model parameters and propagate errors from these parameters to the deuteron binding energy and selected phase-shift parameters. The uncertainty values obtained using this approach are validated by directly sampling from the potential parameters. We find very good agreement between two ways of estimating that uncertainty."

Here, we fix this pathology. First, we prove that the linearized radiative transfer equations are causal and covariantly stable by construction. Then, we repeat Spiegel's calculation accounting for the finite speed of photons. We find that the full transfer problem can be solved analytically.

Conversely, in the gluon junction-stopping scenario, the gluon junction is responsible for carrying the entire baryon number. At present, there is no consensus regarding which type of stopping scenario is correct. Based on a multi-source thermal model, our investigation indicates that experimental data analyzed in previous and present studies suggest that the valence quark-stopping scenario is indeed accurate.

      "summary": "arXiv:2505.05754v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Theoretical predictions on the optimal reaction energies are essential for producing superheavy elements (SHEs) beyond Og. Due to the limitation of the targets, synthesizing elements 119 and 120 will require beams of ${}^{50}\\mathrm{Ti}$ and/or ${}^{54}\\mathrm{Cr}$ ions. However, is it reliable to theoretically extrapolate from the well-investigated ${}^{48}\\mathrm{Ca}$ induced reactions to those with heavier projectiles? In this work, we apply the Fusion-by-Diffusion (FBD) concept to answer this question from two perspectives: radial and mass asymmetry degrees of freedom. The FBD concept is employed in the mass asymmetry degree of freedom for the first time, in which by fitting the calculations to experimental evaporation residue cross sections (ERCS) for the reactions of ${}^{48}\\mathrm{Ca}$ as projectiles with the actinide targets, a strong linear correlation between the contact distance ($D_\\mathrm{cont}$) and center-of-mass energy excess above the Coulomb barrier ($E_\\mathrm{c.m.}-B_0$) is found and a parametrization of the $D_\\mathrm{cont}$ is introduced. Using the result of parametrization, the calculations satisfactorily reproduce the shapes of all hot fusion excitation functions and values of the ERCS. Furthermore, thanks to the recent experimental data, we extrapolate the calculation in the reactions \\({}^{50}\\mathrm{Ti}+{}^{242}\\mathrm{Pu}\\), \\({}^{50}\\mathrm{Ti}+{}^{244}\\mathrm{Pu}\\), and \\({}^{54}\\mathrm{Cr}+{}^{238}\\mathrm{U}\\). The calculations reproduce the experimental data rather well within the experimental errors in both perspectives. Our results demonstrate that there is no non-negligible systematic deviation in extrapolating the projectiles from $^{48}\\text{Ca}$ to $^{50}\\text{Ti}$ and $^{54}\\text{Cr}$ for synthesizing SHEs beyond Og."

In order to address discrepancies in the literature, the calculation is performed at a heavy pion mass in the limit that the light quark masses are equal to the physical strange quark mass, $m_\\pi = m_K \\simeq 714 $ MeV. Using a state-of-the-art momentum space method, we rule out the presence of a bound di-nucleon in both the isospin 0 (deuteron) and 1 (di-neutron) channels, in contrast with many previous results that made use of compact hexaquark creation operators. In order to diagnose the discrepancy, we add such hexaquark interpolating operators to our basis and find that they do not affect the determination of the two-nucleon finite volume spectrum, and thus they do not couple to deeply bound di-nucleons that are missed by the momentum-space operators. Further, we perform a high-statistics calculation of the HAL QCD potential on the same gauge ensembles and find qualitative agreement with our main results. We conclude that two-nucleons do not form bound states at heavy pion masses and that previous identification of deeply bound di-nucleons must have arisen from a misidentification of the spectrum from off-diagonal elements of a correlation function."

A detailed analysis is presented on how momentum is transferred from length scales on the order of the London penetration depth to the vortex core. To examine the momentum flux, expressions for proton and electron currents are derived for arbitrary distances from the vortex line. It is shown that, in the regime of a large electron mean free path, the only force acting directly on the vortex core is the Magnus force. Notably, the correction to the proton current near the vortex core generates a component of the Magnus force aligned with the incident current measured far from the vortex. This contribution, responsible for longitudinal force, is usually overlooked in the literature. The results obtained in this work for a relatively simple problem concerning the force on a vortex in cold matter of neutron stars may also be relevant to other superconducting systems."

Non-relativistic quantum-mechanical systems like the hydrogen atom have been appealed to in these debates as analogies. Since such appeals are likely to continue, it is important to have Galilei-covariant expressions for matrix elements of the energy-momentum tensor. In this work, I obtain Galilei-covariant breakdowns of such matrix elements into mechanical form factors, with a special focus on spin-half states. I additionally study the spatial densities associated with these form factors, using the pilot wave interpretation to guide their breakdown into contributions from internal structure and from quantum-mechanical effects such as wave packet dispersion. For completeness, I also obtain non-relativistic Breit frame densities."

However, robust modeling of these cross sections remains challenging. For a simple but physically motivated toy model of the DUNE experiment, we demonstrate that an accurate neural-network model of the cross section -- leveraging Standard Model symmetries -- can be learned from near-detector data. We then perform a neutrino oscillation analysis with simulated far-detector events, finding that the modeled cross section achieves results consistent with what could be obtained if the true cross section were known exactly.

We have implemented different algorithms to appropriately describe the dynamics of soft-modes for a wide range of temperatures and under non-equilibrium conditions. The non-equilibrium state has been realized starting from an over-occupied initial condition for low momentum soft gluons whereas the thermal state comprises of strongly interacting soft gluons at temperatures where these are well separated from the hard momentum modes. Spectra of positive Lyapunov exponents is observed in both these states, similar to a chaotic dynamical system. From the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy rate measured in terms of this spectrum, we estimate a typical time-scale of $\\sim 0.50(3)$ fm/c to achieve thermalization at $T\\sim 600$ MeV starting from the non-thermal state. We also measure, for the first time, the $\\lambda_L$ for long wavelength critical modes of SU(2) using the out-of-time-ordered correlator of a classical $Z_2$ scalar field theory, which shares the same universal behavior with SU(2), near the deconfinement phase transition.

The analysis shows a monotonic trend for C2/C1 and C3/C2, while the UrQMD model cannot describe the non-monotonic energy dependence for C4/C2 for the most central Au + Au collisions measured by STAR. Finally, we investigated the energy dependence of proton factorial cumulants and found a sign change, as well as fluctuations at low energies.

In this regard, we have studied the observable-directed flow ($v_1$) of identified hadrons, particularly the $v_1$ of baryons and antibaryons, as well as the splitting observed between them in detail. We propose a new ansatz for the initial baryon distribution. By employing this initial baryon deposition model alongside a tilted energy distribution as inputs to a hybrid framework, we successfully describe the rapidity-odd $v_1$ of identified hadrons, including the elusive baryon-antibaryon splitting of $v_1$ across a wide range of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. Our model, incorporating baryon stopping and it's subsequent diffusion within a relativistic hydrodynamic framework and employing a crossover equation of state derived from lattice QCD calculations, establishes a non-critical baryonic baseline. Moreover, we demonstrate that recent STAR measurements of the centrality and system-size dependence of $v_1$ splitting between oppositely charged hadrons-attributed to electromagnetic field effects-are significantly influenced by background contributions from baryon stopping and its diffusion. Furthermore, we show that the rapidity dependence of the splitting of the rapidity-even component of $v_1$ between $p$ and $\\bar{p}$ is highly sensitive to the initial baryon deposition scheme. If measured experimentally, this could constraint the rapidity dependence of the initial baryon deposition profile. Moreover, it could offer valuable phenomenological insights into the baryon junction picture and help refine constraints on the baryon diffusion coefficient of the medium. Notably, utilizing this phenomenologically successful baryon deposition model, we present the first estimation of the baryon diffusion coefficient for the strongly interacting QCD matter created in HIC."

These transitions play a key role in numerous processes in the domain of nuclear physics. Equally important is their contribution in astrophysics, particularly in nuclear synthesis and supernova-explosions. In situations where allowed GT transitions are not favored, first-forbidden transitions become significant, specifically in medium heavy and heavy nuclei. For neutron-rich nuclei, first-forbidden transitions are favored mainly due to the phase-space amplification for these transitions. In this work we calculate the allowed GT as well as unique first-forbidden (U1F) $|\\Delta$J$|$ = 2 transitions strength in odd-odd and even-even nuclei in mass range $70\\leq A \\leq214$. Two different pn-QRPA models were used with a schematic separable interaction to calculate GT and U1F transitions. The inclusion of U1F strength improved the overall comparison of calculated terrestrial $\\beta$-decay half-lives in both models. The \\textit{ft} values and reduced transition probabilities for the $2^-\\longleftrightarrow 0^+$ transitions were also calculated. We compared our calculations with the previously reported correlated RPA calculation and experimental results. Our calculations are in better agreement with measured data.

All these physical parameters are considered to be extremely important in stellar interior.

Within this picture cold isospin QCD matter is constituted by the Bose-Einstein condensate of pions and free (anti)quarks. We develop a simple confining model of pions existing as the lowest energy $P$-state of in-medium three-dimensional harmonic oscillator and use it to show that under the conditions of isospin QCD quarkyonic matter can onset at densities significantly smaller than the overlap density of pions. Using the experimentally established pion charge radius we demonstrate that the onset density can be even lower than two nuclear saturation densities. To analyze the lattice QCD data we develop a field-theory inspired model of quark-antiquark-pion matter with vector-isovector repulsion among pions and (anti)quarks. The quark substructure of pions, which is one of the key elements of the model, is accounted for within the one-loop no-sea approximation and leads to an effective medium dependence of the pion mass. The latter is shown to be crucial for providing asymptotic vanishing of the pion density and pion condensate, which reflects pion dissociation due to asymptotic freedom of QCD. The proposed quarkyonic picture of isospin QCD agrees with the results of perturbative calculations on reaching the conformal limit of QCD and with the data of lattice simulations, which supports its viability and physical relevance."

To faithfully represent the uncertainty in this breakdown scale, we develop a hybrid representation of the dense-matter equation of state, which assumes the form of a relativistic mean-field theory at low densities, while remaining agnostic to any nuclear theory at high densities. To achieve this, we use a nonparametric equation of state model to incorporate the correlations of the underlying relativistic mean-field theory equation of state at low pressures and transition to more flexible correlations above some chosen pressure scale. We perform astrophysical inference under various choices of the transition pressure between the theory-informed and theory-agnostic models. We further study whether the chosen relativistic mean-field theory breaks down above some particular pressure and find no such evidence. Using simulated data for future astrophysical observations at about two-to-three times the precision of current constraints, we show that our method can identify the breakdown pressure associated with a potential strong phase transition."

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to effectively image the nuclear modification factors \\( r^{\\textrm{A}}_i(x,Q^2) \\) at the observable level in proton-nucleus collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Specifically, through a combined study of \\( Z \\)-boson production, \\( Z \\)+jet production, and \\( Z+c \\)-jet production, we separately enhance signals arising from light-quark, gluon, and heavy-flavor (charm) distributions in nuclei. This enables us to effectively image the \\( r^{\\textrm{A}}_i(x,Q^2) \\) for specific parton species. The feasibility of this method is validated through perturbative calculations at next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant, employing three sets of nuclear PDF parametrizations: EPPS21, nCTEQ15, and TUJU19. Future measurements of these observables are expected to provide more efficient constraints on nuclear PDFs and yield new insights into the detailed partonic structures of nuclei."

Here we investigate the validity of the CL method on the $24^3 \\times 12$ lattice in the deconfined phase near the deconfinement phase transition. As before, we use four-flavor staggered fermions and judge the validity using the criterion based on the probability distribution of the drift term.

By training neural networks to learn auxiliary functions correlated with the target observable, NCVs can significantly reduce estimator variance while preserving unbiasedness. However, a critical but often overlooked aspect of NCV training is the role of autocorrelated samples generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). While such samples are typically discarded for error estimation due to their statistical redundancy, they may contain useful information about the structure of the underlying probability distribution that can benefit the training process. In this work, we systematically examine the effect of using correlated configurations in training neural control variates. We demonstrate, both conceptually and numerically, that training on correlated data can improve control variate performance, especially in settings with limited computational resources. Our analysis includes empirical results from $U(1)$ gauge theory and scalar field theory, illustrating when and how autocorrelated samples enhance NCV construction. These findings provide practical guidance for the efficient use of MCMC data in training neural networks."

We find that the predicted suppression in small systems is almost entirely due to elastic energy loss. Our results are keenly sensitive to the crossover between elastic energy loss calculated with hard thermal loop propagators and vacuum propagators, respectively, which leads to a large theoretical uncertainty. We find that the $R_{AB}$ is largely insensitive to the form of the elastic energy loss distribution - Gaussian or Poisson - surprisingly so in small systems where the central limit theorem is inapplicable. We present an expansion of the $R_{AB}$ in terms of the moments of the energy loss probability distribution, which allows for a rigorous understanding of the dependence of the $R_{AB}$ on the underlying energy loss distribution."

The effect of parton-parton scattering cross section on $r_{2}$ and $r_{3}$ is studied which suggests that longitudinal decorrelation could be a potential observable to constrain transport properties of the medium. We also analyze the contributions of flow-plane and flow magnitude decorrelation, with flow-plane decorrelation being dominant. we measure a recently proposed observable, the four particle cumulant ($T_{2}$), which remains resilient to non-flow effects and exhibits sensitivity to different decorrelation patterns. Through the measurement of $T_{2}$, we consistently observe a hint of S-shaped or torqued decorrelation across all energy ranges in peripheral collisions (40-80\\%).

These two parametrizations are the limiting cases of a wide variety of smooth equations of state, i.e. the softest and stiffest possible one without a phase transition, that generate masses and radii compatible with 2M$_\\odot$ observations and the tidal constraint from GW170817. With an exhaustive analysis of the possible stable mass-radius configurations, we determine the quantity of dark matter contained in stars with masses and radii compatible with the aforementioned astrophysical constraints. We find that for dark particle masses of a few tenths of GeV, the dark core collapses and no stable solutions are found for the two limiting ordinary matter equations of state. For lower masses, the dark matter fraction is limited to 10%, being at most 1% for masses ranging from 0.1 to 10 GeV for the limiting soft nuclear equation of state. For the limiting stiff nuclear equation of state, the dark matter fraction can reach values of more than 10%, but the dark particle mass is being constrained to 0.3 GeV and 10 GeV for the weak self-interacting case and has to be at least 5 GeV for the strong self-interacting one. For dark particle masses of less than 0.1 GeV, stable neutron star configurations should have less than 1% of self-interacting dark matter to be compatible with the constraint of the tidal deformability from GW170817 for the two limiting ordinary matter equations of state studied."

We show that the hydrodynamization epoch is itself characterized by two independent timescales, an oscillation period and an observable-dependent damping time. We also show how the existence of a hydrodynamization epoch depends on the exact nature of the high-energy quench. There is a universal character to our findings, which can be applied to the short-time behavior of any interacting many-body quantum system after a sudden high-energy quench.

At subsaturation densities, neutron star matter takes non-uniform structures and form the crusts. We find that the Brunt-V\\\"{a}is\\\"{a}l\\\"{a} (BV) frequency increases significantly at densities slightly above the neutron drip density (i.e., neutron stars' inner crusts), which leads to crust $g$-mode oscillations with their frequencies insensitive to the adopted density functional. At larger densities, BV frequency increases as well due to the core-crust transitions and emergence of muons, which lead to core $g$-mode oscillations. It is found that the obtained core $g$-mode frequencies generally increase with the slope of nuclear symmetry energy $L$, which eventually intersect with that of the crust $g$ modes adopting large enough $L$. This leads to the avoid-crossing phenomenon for the global $g$ modes that encompass contributions from both the crust and core. The correlation between the global $g_1$ mode and $L$ is identified for neutron stars with masses $M\\gtrsim 1.4\\ M_{\\odot}$, which enables the measurements of $L$ based on gravitational wave observations. In our future study, the effects of the discontinuities in density or shear modulus should be considered, while the temperature, rotation, magnetic field, and superfluid neutron gas in neutron stars could also play important roles."

The nuclear potentials are obtained by folding the relativistic effective NN interaction (R3Y) with densities derived from the relativistic mean-field (RMF) approach. The RMF formalism with the NL3$^*$ parameter set and the relativistic-Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB) approach with the DDME2 parameter set are used to obtain the medium-independent R3Y and density-dependent R3Y (DDR3Y) NN potentials. The results of these relativistic interactions are compared with the Reid and Paris M3Y NN interactions and their density-dependent versions. Nuclear potentials are used to calculate the fusion barrier characteristics and cross-sections within the $\\ell$-summed Wong model for $^{16}$O+$^{144}$Sm, $^{48}$Ca+$^{208}$Pb, $^{16}$O+$^{154}$Sm, and $^{48}$Ca+$^{238}$U reactions. The relativistic R3Y and DDR3Y NN potentials provide higher cross-sections than both the Reid and Paris versions. The inclusion of in-medium effects in all interactions results in more repulsive potentials, leading to higher fusion barriers and reduced cross-sections. The impact of nuclear shape degrees of freedom is included for $^{16}$O+$^{154}$Sm and $^{48}$Ca+$^{238}$U reactions involving deformed targets. Results using RMF-NL3$^*$ densities are also compared with those from the two-parameter Fermi (2pF) formula for $^{16}$O+$^{154}$Sm, showing higher cross-sections with RMF densities. A comparison of calculated cross-sections with experimental data shows that the R3Y NN potential with RMF-NL3$^*$ densities provides good agreement for reactions involving both spherical and deformed nuclei."

We find that the dynamically generated up quark mass vanishes in the large $N$ limit, and is small for $F<N$, however for $F=N$ there is a sizeable $O(1)$ contribution. While our results are reliable only for small supersymmetry breaking, we observe that extrapolating the $F=N$ result to large supersymmetry breaking would lead to a dynamical up quark mass that is large enough to account for its entire physical mass."

The standard view is that local gauge symmetry is the basis of the pursue of fundamental particles and forces in nature. Another view is that the gauge symmetry is not a symmetry of nature but just a redundancy in description. Naturally, both statements are nothing wrong, but one might feel that there is a slight conceptual conflict between the two points of view. Due to the subtlety of the subject, however, little literature exists that discusses the root of such an anxiety. In the present paper, by making full use of the analytically solvable nature of the quantum Landau problem, we argue that the familiar gauge principle plays a critical role in unraveling a subtle mismatch between the two viewpoints above. We reveal that there exist two types of quantities in gauge theories, which should clearly be discriminated. The first are quantities, which look seemingly gauge-invariant but actually not, whereas the second are genuinely gauge-invariant quantities, which correspond to direct experimental observables."

However, astrophysical expectations for the lowest mass range, $\\lesssim 1.2 \\,M_\\odot$, are uncertain. If such low-mass compact objects exist, ground-based gravitational wave detectors may observe them in binary mergers. Lacking astrophysical expectations for classifying such observations, we go beyond the mass and explore the role of tidal effects. We evaluate how combined mass and tidal inference can inform whether each binary component is a black hole or a neutron star based on consistency with the supranuclear-density equation of state. Low-mass neutron stars experience a large tidal deformation; its observational identification (or lack thereof) can therefore aid in determining the nature of the binary components. Using simulated data, we find that the presence of a sub-solar mass neutron star (black hole) can be established with odds $\\sim 100:1$ when two neutron stars (black holes) merge and emit gravitational waves at signal-to-noise ratio $\\sim 20$. For the same systems, the absence of a black hole (neutron star) can be established with odds $\\sim 10:1$. For mixed neutron star-black hole binaries, we can establish that the system contains a neutron star with odds $\\gtrsim 5:1$. Establishing the presence of a black hole in mixed neutron star-black hole binaries is more challenging, except for the case of a $\\lesssim 1\\,M_{\\odot}$ black hole with a $\\gtrsim 1\\,M_{\\odot}$ neutron star companion.

Focus is given towards real photon production from a highly virtual (and highly energetic) quark, taking into account heavy-quark mass scales [Phys. Rev. C 94, 054902 (2016)], fermion-boson conversion processes [Nucl. Phys. A 793, 128-170 (2007)], as well as coherence effects [Phys. Rev. C 105, 024908 (2022)]. A generalized factorization procedure, such as that used in e-A deep-inelastic scattering, is employed to derive an improved single-scattering medium-induced photon emission kernels that go beyond the traditional in-medium gluon exchange approximation. Diagrams with real-photon emission from the hard quark are classified based on the final-state particles, and include two types of scattering kernels at $O(\\alpha_{em}\\alpha_{s})$ giving the following final states: (i) real photon and real quark, (ii) real photon and real gluon. The collisional kernels, thus derived, include full phase factors from all non-vanishing diagrams and complete second-order derivative terms in the transverse momentum gradient expansion. Moreover, the calculation includes heavy-quark mass effects, thus exploring heavy-quark energy loss. The in-medium parton distribution functions and the related jet transport coefficients have a hard transverse momentum dependence (of the emitted gluon or photon) present within the phase factor. It is observed that the jet transport coefficients resemble the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions."

Here, we investigate the effects of these uncertainties on one’s ability to accurately distinguish new physics signals. For the scenarios discussed here, we find that reactor spectral uncertainties are similar in magnitude to the projected sensitivities pointing towards a need for β spectroscopy measurements below the inverse β decay threshold."

Spin-singlet neutron-neutron and proton-proton pairing is abundant in the nuclear chart but spin-triplet and mixed-spin proton-neutron pairing correlations have also been predicted to form at least in the ground states of certain nuclei. A realistic candidate region is that of the lightest Lanthanides where it was recently demonstrated that the nuclear deformation expected to emerge enhances spin-triplet pairing correlations. In this paper we provide the details of the deformed multimodal Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov theory that lead to this conclusion, as well as the details of the effects identified. We present in detail the response of different pairing correlations to various deformation modes and calculate their signatures in the odd-even staggering of masses. This paper provides a detailed discussion, and some resolutions, on the long-standing question ``what is the effect of nuclear deformation on the various pairing correlations?''"

Calculated ground-state energies of $^4$He, $^6$Li, $^{12}$C, and $^{16}$O converge and agree with experiment within theoretical uncertainties.

Our framework provides a systematic way to access information on the nuclear geometry probed in UPCs, offering new opportunities for studies of nuclear structure using particle production as a probe.

The equation of states of the NS admixed with DM (DMANS) are calculated by incorporating the self-interactions between them. The macroscopic properties, such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability of the NSs, are obtained for HCD models along with five others by varying self-interaction strength. By combining NS observations with scattering cross-section constraints from galaxy clusters, we explore model-dependent trends in the DM self-interaction parameter space. While the quantitative bounds may vary with hadronic model choice, our analysis offers insights into the interplay between DM interactions and NS observables within the RMF framework."

These neutrons have significant biological effects due to their high quality factor, potentially leading to secondary cancers. Material and method: A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted using the MCNPX code to model an Elekta Infinity linear accelerator operating at 18 MV. The accelerator was situated inside a bunker measuring 7.4* 5 m2. To study photoneutron production and the effectiveness of shielding, various concrete mixtures were applied to the walls of the maze and treatment room. Results: Regardless of the modifications, both photon and neutron fluence decreased substantially as the distance from the maze entrance increased. The fluence reduction was more pronounced between the maze entrance and center. The lowest equivalent neutron doses behind the treatment room door were observed when Ord-Lim concrete was used, while the highest doses occurred with Gal-Bar concrete. Conclusion: The configuration of concrete layers within the treatment room and maze walls is a key factor influencing the changes in neutron dose behind the treatment room door. These variations result from differences in concrete composition and the way neutrons are absorbed in different setups."

However, the factorial growth of their complexity has prevented their consistent inclusion in ab initio many-body calculations. For infinite systems at finite temperature, such drawbacks can be overcome using diagrammatic Monte Carlo techniques to resum entire series of Feynman diagrams. We present a diagrammatic Monte Carlo algorithm that can be applied to self-bound systems with discrete energy levels at zero temperature, and demonstrate its potential for the Richardson model of nuclear pairing. We show that sampling the topological space of diagrams allows the inclusion of high-order excitations that are neglected in state-of-the-art approximations used in nuclear physics and quantum chemistry. We propose that sampling the diagrammatic space can overcome the long-standing gap between our microscopic understanding of structure and reactions in nuclear physics."

We investigate an electronic bridge process in the Th III ion, where nuclear excitation occurs via electronic transitions, and demonstrate that a proper choice of laser frequencies can lead to 10,000 enhancement of this effect. Electrons also reduce 1.7 times the lifetime of the nuclear excited state.\n  Additionally, the electronic structure of the Th III ion exhibits features that make it particularly useful for probing new physics. Notably, it contains a metastable state connected to the ground state via a weak M2 transition, which can be utilized for quantum information processing, as well as searches for oscillating axion field, violation of local Lorentz invariance, test of the Einstein's equivalence principle, and measurement of nuclear weak quadrupole moment. The electronic states of the ion present a unique case of level crossing involving the 5f, 6d, and 7s single-electron states. This crossing renders the transition frequencies highly sensitive to potential time-variation of the fine-structure constant."

Both the electric and magnetic fields are considered to be exponentially decaying with time, and the study is valid in the regime where the magnetic field strength is weak ($eB\\ll T^2$). The evaluation has been done in the kinetic theory framework wherein we have solved the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation within the relaxation time approximation collision kernel. We have shown that the constant weak field results as well as the $B=0$ results in the literature can be obtained as special cases of our general results. We have observed that the shear and bulk viscosities increase with time or equivalently, decrease with the strength of the magnetic field. To connect these observations with experiments, we have calculated the thermalization time, shear viscosity to entropy ratio ($\\eta /s$), and bulk viscosity to entropy ratio ($\\zeta /s$)."

These data are used to benchmark the performance of several relativistic and non-relativistic density functionals, including PC-PK1, TMA, SLy4, SV-min, UNEDF1, and the recently proposed PC-L3R. Results for PC-PK1 and PC-L3R are obtained using the state-of-the-art deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc), while the others are adopted from existing literature. It is found that the DRHBc calculations with PC-PK1 and PC-L3R achieve an accuracy better than 1.5 MeV, outperforming the other functionals, which all exhibit root-mean-square deviations exceeding 2 MeV. The odd-even effects and isospin dependence in these theoretical descriptions are examined. The PC-PK1 and PC-L3R descriptions are qualitatively similar, both exhibiting robust isospin dependence along isotopic chains. Finally, a quantitative comparison between the PC-PK1 and PC-L3R results is presented, with their largest discrepancies analyzed in terms of potential energy curves from constrained DRHBc calculations."

The primary objective of this study is to determine which nuclear bulk properties are sensitive to $Q_{\\beta}$, providing information on the key nuclear characteristics that influence $\\beta$-decay calculations. We employ the Skyrme energy-density functionals to find correlations between $Q_{\\beta}$ and the nuclear bulk properties, assuming spherical symmetry. Using $42$ different Skyrme EDFs, we analyze these correlations by evaluating Pearson linear coefficients, focusing particularly on the relationship between $Q_{\\beta}$ and various nuclear properties. We found that the symmetry energy at low densities shows a correlation with the $Q_{\\beta}$ value. In particular, this correlation becomes stronger for functionals with an effective mass close to $1$. However, as the nuclear density increases, the correlation weakens. From our analysis, we found that a symmetry energy of $32.8\\pm0.7$~MeV and effective mass of $m^{*}/m\\ge0.75$ at the saturation density is the most likely to systematically reproduce the experimental data of $Q_{\\beta}$ systematically."

We show that this formalism is linearly causal and stable around global equilibrium, for any value of the magnetic field and discuss its qualitative differences to the traditional Israel-Stewart formalism in the linear regime. Finally, we compare this framework with the magnetohydrodynamic model used in the study of astrophysical plasmas, in which only the longitudinal component of the shear-stress tensor is considered.

This paper aims at reconciling the aforementioned measurements by utilizing the widely employed color-flavor locked (CFL) MIT bag model. The main objective is related to the examination of the acceptable values for the color superconducting gap $\\Delta$ and the bag parameter $B$. Furthermore, our analysis involves two distinct hypotheses for the nature of compact stars. Firstly, we considered the case of absolute stability for strange quark matter and we found that it is possible to explain both measurements, while also respecting the latest astronomical constraints on the masses and radii of compact stars. Secondly, we studied the case of hybrid stellar matter (transition from hadrons to quarks), and concluded that, when early phase transitions are considered, the simultaneous reconciliation of both measurements leads to results that are inconsistent to the existence of massive compact stars. However, we showed that all current constraints may be satisfied under the consideration that the HESS J1731-347 remnant contains a slow stable hybrid star."

      "summary": "arXiv:2502.01169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We revisit the renormalization group (RG) analysis of the Kohn-Luttinger (KL) mechanism for superconductivity. The KL mechanism leads to superconductivity in a system with a repulsive bare interaction. The key ingredient is the screening effect that renders the induced interaction attractive in channels with nonzero angular momentum $\\ell \\neq 0$, thereby triggering the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) instability. According to the original argument, the resulting gap is exponentially small, with its exponent scaling as $-\\ell^4$. However, the KL mechanism was originally formulated within perturbation theory, where the series is known to converge poorly in certain cases -- most notably, for the p-wave paring gap induced by a repulsive s-wave contact interaction. This poor convergence may be attributed to a divergent integrand in a specific class of diagrams containing both the BCS logarithm and the Kohn anomaly, suggesting that one must resum the Kohn anomaly contributions separately from the BCS logarithm. In this work, we incorporate the Kohn anomaly contribution into the beta function of the RG equation governing the BCS instability near the Fermi surface. Our solution shows that the KL gap exponent is then proportional to $-\\ell$, indicating a significant enhancement of the KL mechanism beyond the previously known result. To illustrate this, we study the spin-triplet p-wave pairing gap arising from a repulsive s-wave contact interaction and compare our RG-based results with those obtained from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in perturbation theory."

In this project, we present the predictive power for the binding energy within the the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) methods with six widely used Skyrme forces (SkM*, SkP, SLy4, SV-min, UNEDF0 and UNEDF1) and evaluate the refined performance of the machine learning based on a novel Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) algorithm to the Skyrme HFB mass models. The root-mean-square (rms) deviations between the bare HFB calculations with different Skyrme forces and the available experimental data range from the minimum, about 1.43 MeV, for the UNEDF0 parameter set to the maximum, about 7.03 MeV, for the SkM* paraterer set. For the CatBoost-refined HFB predictions, the predictive power can be significantly improved. All the prediction accurancies on the testing set can reach the level around 0.2 MeV and, meanwhile, the large model bias can be reduced. The model-repair coefficients for the adopted Skyrme parameter sets are uniformly more than 80\\%. Moreover, for 21 newly measured nuclei outside AME2020, the predicted masses by the CatBoost-refined HFB models are also in good agreement with the experimental data, illustrating their good generalization abilities. Intrestingly, it is found that the optimal Skyrme parameter set that possesses the highest predictive power for the bare HFB mass calculations may be not the best candidate for the CatBoost-refined HFB model, indicating the different abilities of picking up the missing ``physics'' for different Skyrme forces by the CatBoost algorithm."

Furthermore, the Coulomb interaction is found to play an important role in describing absorption mechanisms and reproducing the experimental angular distributions."

Moreover, for systems with three-body interactions, the wave function should account for many-body effects beyond simple pairwise correlations. In this work, we design neural networks that efficiently incorporate these factors to generate expressive wave function Ansatzes for light nuclei using variational Monte Carlo. Our neural-network approach for A=3 nuclei can capture, already at the level of variational Monte Carlo, the overwhelming majority of the ground-state energy estimated by Green's Function Monte Carlo (GFMC). We can find a 91% improvement over standard variational Monte Carlo and achieve a ground state energy within 0.45% of the GFMC result for 3H using the softest chiral interaction with neural networks. The result indicates the potential of neural networks to construct effective trial wave functions for quantum Monte Carlo calculations."

The dynamics of quarkonia in the QGP are encoded in their finite-temperature spectral functions. In this work, we estimate the quarkonium spectral functions in the pseudo-scalar channel using 2+1 flavor lattice QCD with a pion mass of $320\\,\\text{MeV}$, at temperatures of $220\\,\\text{MeV}\\,(1.2\\,T_{pc}),\\,251\\,\\text{MeV}\\,(1.4\\,T_{pc})\\,\\text{and}\\,293\\,\\text{MeV}\\,(1.6\\,T_{pc})$. Reconstructing the spectral function from the Euclidean lattice correlator is a well-known ill-posed problem, requiring additional physics-motivated input. We address this by smoothly matching contributions from different frequency regions of the spectral function, using appropriate physics valid for each region. The spectral function around $\\omega \\sim 2\\,M_q$ is obtained using a non-perturbative complex potential, while for $\\omega \\gg 2\\,M_q$ it is modeled using results from vacuum perturbation theory. Since the pseudoscalar channel does not receive a transport contribution near $\\omega \\sim 0$, we find that the combination of these two regions already provides a good description of the relativistic lattice pseudoscalar correlator. We observe a substantial thermal width in the $\\eta_c(1S)$ state, indicating that pseudoscalar charmonium ($\\eta_c$) is nearing dissolution at the studied temperatures. In comparison, the $\\eta_b$ ground state exhibits little change and remains well-defined."

By considering a large quark mass expansion of a quark determinant in the presence of local pion field and of constituent quark background currents, gluonic effects are considered by means of an effective gluon propagator that dresses quark currents. For the neutral pion, mixing effects are introduced by means of the pion mixing to states $P_0$ and $P_8$, that give rise to the $\\pi^0-\\eta-\\eta'$ meson mixing, and mixing of quark currents via corresponding mixing interactions. The relative behavior of charged and neutral pion coupling constants to quarks may be nearly the same - in the framework of the constituent quark model - as the pion-nucleon coupling constants if mixings are introduced. A very small pion coupling to strange quark current is also obtained. The dependence of the positive and negative pion-constituent quark coupling constant on the non-degeneracy of quark masses, for emission and absorption processes, is identified."

To address this challenge, we introduce a new Monte Carlo method utilizing Normalizing Flows to generate surrogate cross sections that closely approximate those of the original model while significantly reducing computational overhead. As a case study, we built a Monte Carlo event generator for the neutrino-nucleus cross section model developed by the Ghent group. This model employs a Hartree-Fock procedure to establish a quantum mechanical framework in which both the bound and scattering nucleon states are solutions to the mean-field nuclear potential. The surrogate cross sections generated by our method demonstrate excellent accuracy with a relative effective sample size of more than $98.4 \\%$, providing a computationally efficient alternative to traditional Monte Carlo sampling methods for differential cross sections."

      "summary": "We investigate how hadronic scattering cross sections σH of the hadronic transport processes shape charged hadron observables in Au + Au collisions at using the AMPT (A Multi-Phase Transport) model. By adjusting cross sections, we find that larger σH reduces midrapidity charged hadron multiplicity and flattens transverse momentum spectra. While anisotropic flow is secondarily affected by σH due to its dominance by partonic stage dynamics, HBT radii for pions and kaons exhibit strong sensitivity to σH, with elastic and inelastic pion scattering driving spatial expansion. HBT radii of kaons further depend on inelastic interactions with pions, yet increasing kaon cross sections enhances kaon HBT radii without altering pion HBT radii, revealing distinct rescattering mechanisms. These results resolve the HBT underestimation in default AMPT simulations and establish critical constraints for refining transport models and quantifying hadronic viscosity in relativistic heavy-ion collisions."

      "summary": "In this work, the behavior of a lithium (Li) atom within a noncentral interacting endohedral fullerene under spherical confinement and in a quantum plasma environment is investigated. The relevant Schrödinger wave equation is solved using a hybrid approach that combines the tridiagonal matrix method and the asymptotic iteration method. Through this solution, the system’s energy levels, probability densities, dipole polarizabilities, and oscillator strengths are calculated. The changes in plasma density, plasma shielding effect, and endofullerene parameters significantly influence the dynamics of these fundamental properties. Specifically, the analysis of oscillator strengths reveals the strength of electromagnetic interactions during transitions within the system and details how these transitions are affected by plasma, endofullerene confinement, spherical confinement, and angular interactions. Changes in dipole polarizability illustrate how the atom evolves under the influence of these external factors, while differences in oscillator strengths play a critical role in understanding the efficiency of electronic transitions and the system’s interaction with electromagnetic waves. This work contributes to a better understanding of endohedral molecular systems in quantum plasma environments and provides a valuable foundation for modeling the properties of such systems. Moreover, as it serves as an important reference for broader investigations into the dynamics of noncentral endohedral fullerene and quantum plasma interactions at the atomic and molecular levels, it sheds light on future experimental and theoretical studies."

I use this result to calculate the resonant-peak value of the bulk viscosity as a function of density, finding that it strongly depends on $L$, as does the minimum bulk-viscous dissipation timescale. Also resulting from this calculation is a formula for finding the conformal points of the zero-temperature equation of state.

Specifically, we show that the fluctuations of harmonic flow can be probed by the factorization-breaking coefficients between flow vectors in different $p_T$-bins. Experimental difficulty can be reduced by taking one of the flow vectors momentum averaged. Fluctuations cause a decorrelation between the flow vectors, which can be attributed to equal contributions from the flow magnitude and flow angle decorrelation. We study fluctuations of mean transverse momentum per particle ($[p_T]$) in ultra-central collisions and show that our model can explain the steep fall of its variance observed by the ATLAS collaboration. We also present robust predictions for the skewness and kurtosis, and highlight the role of impact parameter fluctuations in ultracentral collisions. We study the Pearson correlation coefficients between $[p_T]$ and $v_n^2$, which can map the initial state correlations between the shape and size of the fireball. We show that higher order normalized and symmetric cumulants between these observables can be constructed, which put useful additional constraints on the initial state properties. Furthermore, we study the momentum dependent Pearson correlation between $[p_T]$ and the transverse momentum dependent flow. It shows sensitivity to the Gaussian width of the nucleon at the initial state.

Due to the interest of using this observable as an input in the construction of potentials between hadrons we revisit the nucleon-nucleon correlation function and calculate it using different nuclear interactions at high precision. Since the nucleon-nucleon potential is determined to reproduce the two-nucleon scattering data, we would like to critically evaluate the amount of this information captured by the correlation function. We study the dependence of the correlations on the nuclear force giving detailed insights into the calculations, in particular the convergence behavior in the partial waves. The coupling between the different partial-wave channels is taken into account and the relevance of this effect is quantified. To make contact with precedent studies the results based on the Argonne V18 interaction are presented. Then we consider also the Norfolk NV2-IIa and NV2-IIb chiral EFT interactions. The analysis of the differences between the correlations of the various interactions shows that for momenta between 0 and 500 MeV there are variations of up to 5.9 % for the $nn$ system, of up to 1.8 % for the $np$ system, and of 1.4 % for the $pp$ system."

Comparing different experimental $\\beta$-shapes to each other and to those predicted by theory in a consistent manner is difficult. This difficulty is compounded when different parameterizations of the $\\beta$-shape function are used. Usually some form of a power polynomial of the total electron energy is chosen for this parametrization. This choice results in extracted coefficients that are highly correlated, with their physical meaning and numerical value dependent on the order of polynomial chosen. This is true for both theoretical and experimental coefficients, and leads to challenges when comparing coefficients from polynomials of different orders. Accurately representing the highly correlated uncertainties is difficult and subtle. These issues impact the underlying physical interpretation of shape function parameters. We suggest an alternative approach based on orthogonal polynomials. Orthogonal polynomials offer more stable coefficient extraction which is less dependent on the order of the polynomial, allow for easier comparison between theory and experimental coefficients from polynomials of different orders, and offer some observations on simple physical meaning and on the statistical limits of the extracted coefficients."

The deuteron wave function consists of both a singlet-singlet color state and additional hidden color states arising from non-trivial color rearrangements. Our results reveal that while the singlet-singlet state is present, the hidden color states collectively dominate, contributing a larger probability to the deuteron wave function.

We introduce a reduced-basis method (RBM) emulator for AFDMC and study it in the simple case of the deuteron. Furthermore, we compare our RBM emulator with the recently proposed parametric matrix model (PMM) that combines elements of RBMs with machine learning. We contrast these two approaches with a traditional Gaussian Process emulator.

We develop a framework to compute the quark-antiquark-gluon component of the pion, starting from its valence light-front wave function. Additionally, the quark and gluon parton distribution functions (PDFs) are derived by considering this higher Fock component in the pion state. The proposed operator, which acts on the valence state to produce the quark-antiquark-gluon component of the pion, is tested against results from BLFQ for its contribution to the quark and gluon PDFs, as well as with results from the BSE. In the BLFQ framework, we identify the effect of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking on the pion structure through the enhancement of the spin-flip matrix element. This enhancement is captured in the $|q\\bar{q}g\\rangle$ component of the light-front wave function and the associated gluon PDF. We explicitly demonstrate an enhancement of the low-$x$ contribution in the quark PDF, which is associated with the large spin-flip matrix element, which also drives the $\\pi-\\rho$ mass splitting. The proposed framework also enables an exploration of the effect of the dressed gluon mass for a given valence state at the pion scale. We show that when the gluon mass vanishes, departing from the constituent gluon picture, it has a significant impact on the gluon PDF."

This indicates that systems of different sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a similar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse flow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system size and $\\eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and their response functions, along with the impact of the $\\eta/s$ and the system transverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in momentum space.

The light-front Hamiltonian is constructed and renormalized using a Fock sector dependent scheme. The derived eigenvalue equation is then solved non-perturbatively to obtain the wave functions, which are then used to compute the current matrix element.\n  We perform a covariant analysis of the current matrix element taking into account possible violation of the Poincar\\'e symmetry due to the Fock sector truncation. The physical form factor depends on two boost invariants $\\zeta, \\Delta^2_\\perp$, instead of the single Lorentz invariant $Q^2$. Instead of adopting the conventional Drell-Yan frame $\\zeta = 0$, we evaluate the form factor in general frames, and use the frame dependence to quantitatively gauge the loss of the Lorentz covariance. Our numerical result shows that as more Fock sectors are included, the frame dependence reduces dramatically. In particular, the anti-nucleon degree of freedom plays an important role in the reduction of the frame dependence, even though it only takes a small portion within the state vector. We also find that there is no zero-mode contribution to the current for the scalar Yukawa theory."

As a result of the spontaneous symmetry breaking, a massive gauge boson arises, which couples differently to the third family of fermions (by assumption, we restrict ourselves to the scenario in which the couples in the same way to the first two families). Two Higgs doublets and one scalar singlet are necessary to generate the SM fermion masses and break the gauge symmetries. We show that in our model, the flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) of the Higgs sector are identically zero if each right-handed SM fermion is only coupled with a single Higgs doublet. This result represents a FCNC cancellation mechanism different from the usual procedure in Two-Higgs Doublet Models. The non-universal nature of our solutions Requires the presence of three right-handed neutrino fields, one for each family. Our model generates all elements of the Dirac mass matrix for quarks and leptons, which is quite non-trivial for non-universal models. Thus, we can fit all the masses and mixing angles with two scalar doublets. Finally, we show the distribution of solutions for the scalar boson masses in our model by scanning well-motivated intervals for the model parameters. We consider two possibilities for the scalar potential and compare these results with the Higgs-like resonant signals recently reported by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC. Finally, we also report collider, electroweak, and flavor constraints on the model parameters."

      "summary": "Due to quantum gravitational effects, Barrow proposed that the black hole horizon is \"fractalized\" into a sphereflake. Based on this idea, in this work we investigate the phase structure and stability of Einstein-Power-Yang-Mills (EPYM) AdS black holes in the restricted phase space, assuming the black hole event horizon has a fractal structure. From the first law of thermodynamics for EPYM AdS black holes in the restricted phase space, we find that the mass parameter should be interpreted as the internal energy. Moreover, the Smarr relation for this system in the restricted phase space is not a homogeneous function due to the fractal structure, which differs significantly from the corresponding relation in the extended phase space. The presence of a fractal structure can be regarded as a probe for phase transitions. Interestingly, for a fixed central charge in the EPYM AdS black hole system with a fractal structure, a supercritical phase transition also exists, similar to the case in the standard EPYM AdS black hole system. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of the fractal parameter ∆ and non-linear Yang-Mills parameter γ on the thermodynamical stability of this system are also investigated."

If the coefficients of such luminosity relations vary with redshift, they could introduce biases into cosmological constraints derived from quasars. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of the redshift variation in the X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity ( - ) relations of quasars. For the standard - relation, we show that the relation coefficients exhibit a strong and linear correlation with redshift that is not attributable to the selection effect. Additionally, we examine two three-dimensional, redshift-evolving - relations and show that the inclusion of a redshift-dependent term does not eliminate the impact of redshift evolution, given that the relation coefficients continue to evolve with redshift. Finally, we construct a new - relation in which the redshift evolution of the relation coefficients is nearly eliminated. By calibrating the luminosity relations using Hubble parameter measurements, we demonstrate that quasars based on the proposed relation yield effective constraints on cosmological parameters that are consistent with results from Planck CMB data, unlike constraints derived from the standard relation."

In this work, we examine the impact of pQCD information on the inference of the EOS using a nonparametric framework based on Gaussian processes (GPs). We examine the application of pQCD constraints through a \"pQCD likelihood,\" and verify the findings of previous works; namely, a softening of the EOS at the central densities of the most massive neutron stars and a reduction in the maximum neutron-star mass. Although the pQCD likelihood can be easily integrated into existing EOS inference frameworks, this approach requires an arbitrary selection of the density at which the constraints are applied. The EOS behavior is also treated differently either side of the chosen density. To mitigate these issues, we extend the EOS model to higher densities, thereby constructing a \"unified\" description of the EOS from the neutron-star crust to densities relevant for pQCD. In this approach the pQCD constraints effectively become part of the prior. Since the EOS is unconstrained by any calculation or data between the densities applicable to neutron stars and pQCD, we argue for maximum modeling flexibility in that regime. We compare the unified EOS with the traditional pQCD likelihood, and although we confirm the EOS softening, we do not see a reduction in the maximum neutron-star mass or any impact on macroscopic observables. Though residual model dependence cannot be ruled out, we find that pQCD suggests the speed of sound in the densest neutron-star cores has already started decreasing toward the asymptotic limit; we find that the speed of sound squared at the center of the most massive neutron star has an upper bound of $\\sim 0.5$ at the $90\\%$ level."

We compute all terms contributing to polarizations and spin correlations, e.g. not only induced polarizations and correlations resulting from unpolarized $np$ scattering, but also contributions from single polarization and correlation transfers from individual polarized incoming nucleons, and, for the first time, allotment to both quantities stemming from a doubly spin polarized initial state. We find that for the most part the final spin states are statistical mixture of states. The only pure states occur for highly polarized incoming neutrons and protons with maximal polarizations; however, these still contain components with each neutron and proton spin projections, and thus cannot be entangled."

Likewise we consider a bank of calculations from simulations of the slow ($s$) neutron capture process and also consider a few calculations for the intermediate ($i$) neutron capture process. We demonstrate that the ML does well overall in recognizing the $s$ process from the $r$ process, and after training on theoretical calculations ML stellar assignments match conventional labels 87% of the time. We highlight that this method then points to stars that could benefit from additional observational measurements. We also demonstrate that the ML assigns some of the presently considered $i$-process stars to instead be of $r$ or $s$ in origin, but likewise, finds stars currently labeled as $s$ to be potentially more aligned with $i$ enrichment. This first application of ML to classify metal-poor star enrichment using theoretical nucleosynthesis calculations thus reveals the promise, and some challenges, associated with this new data-driven path forward."

Experimentally, this was established by measuring azimuthal anisotropies in the final state, known as elliptic flow ($v_2$) or higher order harmonics such as triangular flow ($v_3$). These Fourier harmonic coefficients have been extensively measured in past experiments using inclusive charged particles or identified particles in the soft sector. Interestingly, measuring such coefficients using hard probes, such as quarkonia, brings additional information about heavy-quarks production and thermalization in the QGP. In this study, we investigate quarkonia collectivity using Run 3 data collected in 2023, presenting new flow measurements. We employ different experimental methods to extract flow coefficients, including the scalar product, event plane, and cumulant methods.

We find, consistently, that the extracted $\\alpha_s$ remains relatively unchanged across heavy- and light-flavor final states and across central, semi-central, and peripheral collisions.

For an inverted mass hierarchy of the light neutrinos we find that improved limits on $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ from next-generation experiments, assuming an improvement of two orders of magnitude on the current $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ limits will restrict the allowed parameter space for fixed mass splitting to narrow bands in the mass-mixing plane. Further combining this with the requirement to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis reduces these bands to windows in parameter space that are constrained in all directions and can be targeted by direct searches at accelerators, and restricts the mass splitting to values that can be resolved at experiments. For a normal mass hierarchy, restricting the allowed parameter will require even stronger $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ limits, and only parts of the parameter space can then be probed."

Additionally, two stochastic cooling systems are integrated into the setup. The status of the NICA accelerator complex, including its cooling systems, is presented.

To calculate the optical potentials of these mesons in different nuclei under study, we use the chiral (3) hadronic mean field model, in which the properties of nucleons in the medium are modified through the scalar isoscalar fields σ and ζ and scalar-isovector field δ. The scalar-isovector field δ accounts for the finite isospin asymmetry of different nuclei having asymmetry in the number of protons and neutrons. The binding energy and absorption decay width of mesons are calculated for the ground state and some possible excited states of the nuclei. In the chiral (3) model, the mesons , , and are observed to have a significant negative mass shift up to nuclear saturation density, which leads to the possibility of bound states at least for ground states and some excited states for heavy nuclei. For the pseudoscalar singlet and vector meson ϕ, the mass shift obtained are found to be small, and bound states are not formed. The present calculations are compared with those of different studies conducted in the field and are useful in understanding the outcomes from different experimental facilities focusing on this area of research."

The interaction of jet constituents with the medium can happen during the partonic stage of the jet, during hadronization, and even during its hadronic stage. We demonstrate how flow of the ambient medium in a direction transverse to the jet can introduce both dipole and quadrupole defomations. We propose to analyze the $n=1$ and $n=2$ harmonic deformations of soft and semi-hard hadrons or subjets in a jet with respect to the jet core using the method of $q$-vectors. We discuss simulations which show how the transverse shapes and their preferred angles evolve when the ambient environment of jets changes from the vacuum to a parton medium without flow and finally to a medium with various rates of transverse flow. Our study includes the effects of both flow during the development of the parton shower and hadronization. The existence of dipole deformations, and the correlation of the angles of dipole and quadrupole deformations could constitute promising experimental signals for the presence and size of ambient transverse flow."

While neural networks -- the core of modern artificial intelligence -- have been recently suggested as powerful methods, showcasing high predictive power in the measured region, their ability to extrapolate remains questionable. This limitation stems from their `black box' nature and large number of parameters entangled with nonlinear functions designed in the context of computer science. In this study, we demonstrate that replacing such nonlinear functions with physics-related functions significantly improves extrapolation performance and provides enhanced understanding of the model mechanism. Using only the information about neutron (N) and proton (Z) numbers without any existing global mass models or knowledge of magic numbers, we developed a highly accurate model that covers light nuclei (N, Z > 0) up to the drip lines. The extrapolation performance was rigorously evaluated using the outermost nuclei in the measurement landscape, and only the data in the inner region was used for training. We present details of the method and model, along with opportunities for future improvements."

In this work, we present a novel, data-driven approach to constrain $\\Lambda_{1.4}$ without invoking specific equation-of-state(EOS) models. By interpolating directly over the mass--tidal-deformability posteriors from GW170817, we obtain an EOS-independent constraint of $ \\Lambda_{1.4} \\;=\\; 222.89_{-98.85}^{+420.33}. $ We further combine these GW-based results with the X-ray EOS-independent constraint from \\cite{Huang_2025}, deriving a multimessenger limit of $ \\Lambda_{1.4} \\;=\\; 265.18_{-104.38}^{+237.88}, $ which remains largely EOS agnostic. This framework demonstrates that higher-order terms neglected in linear expansion methods do not significantly affect $\\Lambda_{1.4}$ estimates under current observational uncertainties. As gravitational-wave detectors improve in sensitivity and more binary neutron-star mergers are discovered, our purely data-driven strategy can serve as a robust standard baseline for extracting neutron-star interior properties without relying on unverified EOS models."

Investigations of the coupling present within isoscalar modes and within isovector modes are scarce but important for advancing our understanding of the microscopic picture of nuclei. To explore some of these underlying coupling features, and to test the predictive power of a state-of-the-art nuclear structure approach, we provide a detailed analysis of the properties of $^{90,96,98}$Zr. This region includes a benchmarking case and offers insights into nuclear deformation phenomena. To investigate the coupling between collective modes in deformed nuclei, we focused our analysis on the ground and excited-state properties of these isotopes, employing a consistent approach with the axially-symmetric deformed Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) and the Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation (QRPA) framework, both using the Gogny D1M force. This approach effectively describes both low-lying and giant-resonance states. We devoted special attention to the deformed $^{98}$Zr nucleus, where we confirm the existence of coupling between monopole and quadrupole excitations through the $K^{\\pi} = 0^{+}$ QRPA components and demonstrate an analogous dipole-octupole coupling through the $K^{\\pi} = 0^{-}$ and $K^{\\pi} = 1^{-}$ components. Intrinsic transition densities and associated radial projections illustrate the coupling. Our work complements and extends earlier studies carried out using density-functional-based methods and notably, we included the complete Coulomb interaction also in the pairing fields, i.e. we treat terms exactly that are approximated in typical calculations that use the Gogny D1 and D2 interaction families."

Here, we use the Feynman-Hellmann method to determine this subtraction function directly from lattice QCD. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to control dominant discretisation artefacts for this calculation, eliminating a major source of systematic error. This calculation is performed for a range of hard momentum scales, and three different sets of gauge configurations for pion masses about 400 MeV. Our results show good agreement with continuum OPE expectations.

Based on a linear Boltzmann transport model that incorporates both Yukawa and string types of interactions between heavy quarks and the QGP, we study the production and evolution of heavy quarks and $B_c$ mesons within the same framework. A $B_c$ bound state dissociates while one of its constituent heavy quarks scatters with the QGP with momentum transfer greater than its binding energy. The medium-modified charm and bottom quarks can recombine into $B_c$ mesons, and the medium-modified bottom quarks can also fragment to $B_c$ mesons. We find that most primordial $B_c$ mesons generated from the initial hard collisions dissociate inside the QGP. The production of $B_c$ mesons is primarily driven by the recombination mechanism at low transverse momentum and fragmentation at high transverse momentum. The string interaction dominates over the Yukawa interaction in the nuclear modification of $B_c$ mesons. The participant number dependence of the $B_c$ meson $R_\\mathrm{AA}$ is determined by the complicated interplay between the heavy quark yield, energy loss, and the QGP volume. We obtain a reasonable description of the $R_\\mathrm{AA}$ of $B_c$ mesons in Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}=5.02$ TeV, and provide predictions for Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}=200$ GeV."

We take as input the β-decay half-lives and the one-neutron separation energy of the nuclei in the rare-earth region. The output is the final isotopic abundance pattern. In this work, we focus on the nuclear data and abundance patterns in the rare-earth region to reduce the dimension of the input and output space. We show that the ANN can capture the effect of the changes in the nuclear physics inputs on the final r-process abundance pattern in the adopted astrophysical conditions. We employ the deep ensemble method to quantify the prediction uncertainty of the neural network emulator. The emulator achieves a speed-up by a factor of about 20 000 in obtaining a final abundance pattern in the rare-earth region. The emulator may be utilized in statistical analyses such as uncertainty quantification, inverse problems, and sensitivity analysis."

To calculate the relative level ordering, harmonic oscillator wavefunctions and a residual $\\delta$ interaction are used. The simplistic approach confirms for the particle-particle channel, the often stated preference of the $\\Delta j=3, \\Delta l =3$ subshell combination over the $\\Delta j=3, \\Delta l =1$ subshell combination through an enhanced energy gain. Furthermore, it is shown that, in the particle-hole channel, the gain is less pronounced for the $\\Delta j=3, \\Delta l =3$ subshell configuration. In combination with the overall structure of an oscillator shell, these results explain the comparatively low excitation energy for 3$^-_1$ excitations observed for the octupole-soft proton and neutron numbers predicted by various models."

We construct unified EoSs for $npe\\mu$ matter, where the inner crust of the NS is treated using an extended Thomas-Fermi method, providing for the first time a fully consistent Bayesian treatment of the correlation of bulk with surface as well as with spin-orbit and effective mass parameters. We then employ a standard Bayesian framework to identify those EoSs that satisfy astrophysical constraints from NS mass measurements, the tidal deformability from GW170817, and NICER mass-radius observations. We also examine NS observables, such as the crustal moment of inertia, which is crucial in understanding pulsar glitches. Compared to previous works, we observe an increase in both the NS surface thickness and the crustal moment of inertia."

While various theoretical models have been proposed, including hadronic molecular and compact tetraquark interpretations, some experimental evidence suggests that the $X(3872)$ may be a mixture state of a hadronic molecule and a $c\\bar{c}$ core. In this work, we perform a systematic study of the hidden-charm tetraquark candidates $X(3860)$, $X(3872)$, and $Z(3930)$ using a coupled-channel model that incorporates both $c\\bar{c}$ states and $D^{(*)}\\bar{D}^{(*)}$ hadronic molecular components. The $c\\bar{c}$ sector is described based on the constituent quark model predictions for the $\\chi_{cJ}(2P)$ ($J = 0, 1, 2$) states, while the meson-meson interactions are modeled using pseudoscalar and vector meson exchange potentials. The model parameters are fixed to reproduce the masses of the $X(3872)$ and $Z(3930)$, and the resulting framework is used to predict the mass and structure of the $J^{PC} = 0^{++}$ state associated with the $X(3860)$. Our results support the mixture interpretation of these exotic hadrons, exhibiting strong attractions from the transition potential between $c\\bar{c}$ and $D^{(*)}\\bar{D}^{(*)}$ components. The molecular component is found to dominate in the $X(3872)$, while the $c\\bar{c}$ component plays a more prominent role in the $X(3860)$ and $Z(3930)$."

These axions solve the strong-charge-parity (CP) problem, but have a mass-squared lighter than that due to QCD by a factor of $\\varepsilon<1$. Inside dense matter, the axion potential is altered, and much of the matter in neutron stars resides in the axion condensed phase where the strong-CP parameter $\\theta =\\pi$ and CP remains a good symmetry. In these regions, masses and interactions of nuclei are modified, in turn changing the equation of state (EOS), structure and phenomenology of the neutron stars.

In the last decade, CISM has progressed in investigating the cross-shell excitation in exotic light nuclei, the similarity and diference in mirror nuclei, and the isomerism and seniority conservation in medium and heavy nuclei. Additionally, researchers have attempted to construct effective Hamiltonians for nuclei near 132Sn and 208Pb through a unifed way in the CISM framework. In parallel, related models, including the nucleon-pair approximation (NPA) approach, the Monte Carlo shell model (MCSM), the projected shell model (PSM), the Gamow shell model (GSM), etc., have also been extensively developed and validated in the last decade.

Since the topological charge that naturally appears on the right hand side of the BPS bound is a non-linear function of the baryonic charge, the thermodynamics of these magnetized Baryonic layers is highly non-trivial. In this work, using tools from the theory of Casimir effect, we derive analytical relationship between baryonic charge, topological charge, magnetic flux and relevant thermodynamical quantities (such as pressure, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility) of these layers. The critical Baryonic chemical potential is identified. Quite interestingly, the grand canonical partition function can be related with the Riemann zeta function. On the technical side, it is quite a remarkable result to derive explicit expressions for all these thermodynamics quantities of a strongly interacting magnetized system at finite Baryon density. On the physical side, such expressions allow a direct physical interpretation which we discuss."

Specifically, for {$B = 1.618 \\, \\mathrm{GeV}^2=2.592 \\times 10^{19}$ Gauss}, we identify two distinct CEPs at $(T_C = 87.3 \\, \\mathrm{MeV}, \\, \\mu_C = 115.9 \\, \\mathrm{MeV})$ and $(T_C = 78.9 \\, \\mathrm{MeV}, \\, \\mu_C = 244.0 \\, \\mathrm{MeV})$. Notably, the critical exponents vary depending on the CEP's location. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the QCD phase structure and provide concrete predictions for experimental validation at upcoming facilities such as FAIR, JPARC-HI, and NICA."

      "summary": "arXiv:2410.16368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Energy correlators have recently come to the forefront of jet substructure studies at colliders due to their remarkable properties: they naturally separate physics at different scales, are robust to contamination from soft radiation, and offer a direct connection with quantum field theory. The current parametrization used for energy correlators, however, is based on redundant pairwise angles with complex phase space restrictions. In this Letter, we introduce a new parametrization of energy correlators that features a simpler phase space structure and preserves information about the orientation of jet constituents. Further, our parametrization drastically reduces the computational cost to compute energy correlators on experimental data; whereas the time to compute a traditional projected $N$-point energy correlator scales as $M^N/N!$ on a jet with $M$ particles, our new parametrization achieves a scaling of $M^2 \\log M$, remarkably independently of N. Even for N=3, this improved scaling is particularly important for studies of heavy ion collisions, and higher values of $N$ will enable new qualitative understanding of gauge theories. Theoretical calculations for our new energy correlators differ from those of traditional parametrizations only at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy and beyond, and we expect that our simpler phase space structure will simplify those calculations. We also discuss how to extend our parametrization to resolved $N$-point energy correlators that encode angular distances between greater numbers of particles, yielding intuitive visualizations of jet substructure that are qualitatively different for different jet samples. We propose two possible generalizations for probing multi-prong jets and testing jet scaling behavior."

The momentum zero mode of these correlations reveals the dynamic formation of a condensate, while at nonzero momenta, energy is transported toward the ultraviolet. We demonstrate that the non-zero momentum dynamics is well described by a direct cascade in terms of gauge-invariant Polyakov loop excitations, exhibiting self-similar prescaling indicative of a nonthermal attractor. This behavior can be analytically understood through perturbation theory for the Polyakov loop correlations and the established dynamics of gauge field correlations. We perform simulations for both $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge groups, providing further consistency checks on the $N_c$-dependence of perturbative expectations. No evidence of an inverse cascade toward lower momenta is found for momenta above the electric screening scale."

We show how measurements of these jets teach us about the resolution length $L_{\\rm res}$ of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and can teach us how jet substructure shapes the wakes that jets excite in the QGP droplets through which they pass. We use Hybrid Model calculations to reproduce measurements of $R_{AA}$ for large-radius jets in PbPb collisions, and study their dependence on the angle between the two skinny subjets involved in the final reclustering step of an $R=1$ jet. We show how these observables can constrain the value of $L_{\\rm res}$ and demonstrate that the ATLAS data rule out any picture in which an entire parton shower loses energy coherently as if it were a single entity. Determining the degree to which the QGP can resolve partons within a jet is central to the broader program of using jet quenching measurements to probe QGP.\n  We make further use of this setup by analyzing the response of the medium to the passage of large-radius $R=2$ jets containing two skinny subjets in gamma-jet events. We introduce novel jet-shape observables that allow us to visualize the angular shape of the soft hadrons originating from the wakes that wide jets with two skinny subjets excite in a droplet of QGP, as a function of the angular separation between the subjets. We find that even when they are $\\sim 0.8- 1$ radian apart, a single broad wake is produced. Only when the two subjets are even farther apart is the presence of two sub-wakes revealed. We show that the way in which jet structure shapes jet wakes can be visualized with similar clarity in experiments by using only those hadrons with low $p_T$. These observables thus offer a new and distinctive way of seeing jet wakes in heavy ion collision data."

It is shown that there is an infinite family of self-interaction potentials which admit Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bounds together with the corresponding first-order BPS systems. For each member of this family, the solutions of the first-order BPS systems are automatically solutions of the corresponding second-order generalized GPE. The simplest topologically non-trivial solutions of these first-order BPS systems describe configurations with quantized fractional vorticity. The corresponding fraction is related to the degree of non-linearity. The case in which the self-interaction potential is of order six (namely $|\\Psi |^{6}$, which is a relevant theory both in relativistic quantum field theories in $(2+1)$ dimensions in connection with the quantum Hall effect as well as in the theory of the supersolids) is analyzed in detail. Such formalism can also be extended to the case of quantum mixtures with multi-component GPEs. The relationship between these techniques and supersymmetry will be discussed. In particular, despite several common features, we will show that there are multi-component GPEs that are not supersymmetric (at least, not in the standard sense) and possess a BPS system of the above type."

The hot QCD medium is simplified as a fermionic system consisting of only quarks. The spin of heavy quarks can be polarized as a result of combined contributions from spin-spin interactions between quarks and spin-magnetic field interactions. This spin dynamics is modeled as consisting of a polarization term and a dissipation term, which is described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation and widely studied in condensed matter physics, analogous to the momentum evolution in the Langevin equation. In this study, we calculate the Gilbert damping factor that characterizes the spin polarization rate of heavy quarks, considering a Coulomb potential between two fermions in the medium. The dependence of the heavy quark spin polarization rate on the strength of the magnetic field, the heavy quark mass, temperature, and baryon chemical potential is studied in detail. This analysis contributes to a better understanding of quark spin dynamics in the hot QCD medium and the magnetic field."

In this study, we explore a relativistic framework for the finite-temperature $\\beta$-equilibrium limit of equation of state (EOS), constrained via a Bayesian inference methodology. The EOS is constrained by minimal approximations on a few nuclear saturation properties, low-density pure neutron matter constraints from chiral effective field theory, and a neutron star (NS) maximum mass greater than 2.0 $M_{\\odot}$. Two sets of EOS derived from the relativistic mean field model for nucleonic and hyperonic matter constrained by a Bayesian inference calculation at the zero temperature limit are used. The thermal adiabatic index ($\\Gamma_{\\rm Th}$) is calculated as a function of the baryonic density across several temperatures for both the sets. Our results suggest that the maximum NS mass is of the order of 2.15 $M_\\odot$ if hyperons are present. In addition, the present study suggests that an observation of NS with mass larger than $2.2\\ M_{\\odot}$ can indirectly indicates the absence of hyperons in its core. The deleptonization of hyperonic PNS reduces the stellar maximum mass rendering the PNS exceeding the zero temperature maximum stellar (baryonic) mass limit becomes metastable which is prone to collapse into a black hole while PNS below such a mass threshold evolves to a stable NS."

We also use our EOSs to obtain neutron star mass-radius relations and their uncertainties.

In addition, over the last few years, discussion has started on the appearance of small triaxiality in nuclei considered so far as purely axial rotors. In the present work we collect the predictions made by various theoretical approaches and show that pronounced triaxiality appears to be favored within specific stripes on the nuclear chart, with low triaxiality being present in the regions between these stripes, in agreement with parameter-free predictions made by the proxy-SU(3) approximation to the shell model, based on the Pauli principle and the short-range nature of the nucleon-nucleon interaction. The robustness of triaxiality within these stripes is supported by global calculations made in the framework of the Finite-Range Droplet Model (FRDM), which is based on completely different assumptions and possesses parameters fitted in order to reproduce fundamental nuclear properties."

Observational radio astronomy with uGMRT and OORT facilities has led to several important breakthroughs in studies of different kinds of pulsars and their emission mechanisms. On the other hand, accretion processes around compact objects are at the core of Indian astronomy research. In this context, AstroSat mission revolutionized spectro-temporal observations and measurements of accretion phenomena, quasi-periodic oscillations, and jet behaviour in binary systems hosting compact objects. Moreover, recently launched XPoSat mission is set to provide an impetus to these high-energy phenomena around compact objects by enabling us to conduct polarization measurements in the X-ray band. Further, during the past decade, numerous gravitational wave signals have been observed from coalescing black holes and neutron stars in binary systems. Recent simultaneous observation of the GW170817 event in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic channels has ushered in the era of multi-messenger astronomy. In the future, synergistic efforts among several world-class observational facilities, e.g., LIGO-India, SKA, TMT, etc., within the Indian astrophysics community will provide a significant boost to achieve several key science goals that have been delineated here. In general, this article plans to highlight scientific projects being pursued across Indian institutions in this field, the scientific challenges that this community would be focusing on, and the opportunities in the coming decade.

Here we investigate the existence of pasta in neutron stars within the semiclassical extended Thomas-Fermi approach using various generalized Skyrme functionals. The filling fractions for the different transitions are found to be quasi-universal, unlike the pasta density ranges governed by the symmetry energy at relevant densities. In particular, pasta emerge at $u_\\mathrm{sp}\\approx0.13-0.15$. By applying a simplified stability criterion within the liquid-drop framework, we show that these values of $u_\\mathrm{sp}$ can be explained by the nuclear curvature correction.

In this work, we explore the implications of this non-covariance in depth. In particular, we discuss how predictions differ between observers moving at nearly luminal speeds relative to each other. We find that all disagreements stem from the relativity of simultaneity, which introduces frame-dependent anisotropic delays in the diffusive process. These anisotropies significantly limit the applicability of the equation used by observers who move very fast relative to the medium. However, the magnitude of the related error remains finite at infinite Lorentz factors, meaning that it is possible to find a regime where all observers agree on the outcome of experiments."

The discussion focuses on recent experiments using relativistic Coulomb excitation in inelastic proton scattering at extreme forward angles covering a mass range from $^{40}$Ca to $^{208}$Pb. Constraints on the neutron skins and the density dependence of the symmetry energy are derived from systematic comparison to calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio methods utilizing interactions derived from chiral effective field theory ($\\chi$EFT). The results consistently favor a soft EOS around or slightly below the saturation point.

In this work, we show that further constraints on the spectral densities significantly reduce the possible solutions to a small set of qualitatively similar ones. Quantitatively, the precise solution is controlled by the asymptotic value of the form factors and SVZ sum rules. We also introduce an iterative procedure that, starting from a generic feasible point, converges to a unique solution parameterized by the UV input. For the converged solution we compute masses and widths of resonances that appear, scattering lengths and effective ranges of partial waves, low energy coefficients in the effective action. Additionally, we use these results to discuss the thermodynamics of a pion gas including pair correlations of pions with same and opposite charge."

In this work, we conduct a detailed study of $v_0(p_\\mathrm{T})$ using a blast-wave model that incorporates hydrodynamic-like expansion and thermal emission. We introduce event-by-event fluctuations in the transverse expansion velocity and kinetic freeze-out temperature using Gaussian probability distributions.

This generalizes the early work by Li and Haldane [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 067003 (2018)] to systems with additional internal quantum numbers, such as color. In the ultrarelativistic limit, we uncover rich topological structures driven by the interplay of spin, chirality, and color. Specifically, we identify chirality-induced topological nodes in the transverse (opposite chirality pairing) polar and A phases. In contrast, the color-spin-locking phase lacks these nodes due to a nontrivial color Berry flux, which in turn induces gapless excitations with total Berry monopole charges of $\\pm 3/2-$differing from conventional Weyl fermions. Our findings can be potentially extended to other fermionic systems carrying additional internal degrees of freedom."

However, at low momentum transfer Q2, in the regime where the strong force becomes extremely strong, our understanding of QCD for ordinary nucleons becomes hazy. Several cutting edge theories such as Chiral Perturbation Theory and Lattice QCD have provided valuable predictions in this regime, but Lattice QCD has not yet extended predictions of many important quantities to this kinematic region, and Chiral Perturbation Theory has faced several important disagreements with experimental data for the neutron over the last several decades. It is therefore of extreme importance to have a benchmark of experimental data in the low energy regime for the proton's behavior, as a test of leading theories for the behavior of QCD in this regime. The E08-027 (g2p) experiment ran at Jefferson Lab in 2012 with the goal of collecting this valuable data. Full details of the g2p experiment and my experimental work at the University of New Hampshire are presented in this thesis, as well as a detailed description of the analysis process and the exciting benchmark results, which serve as a direct test of all current and future theories of QCD in the low-Q2 regime."

Our examples for Channel 1 involve the formation of lower-gap and above black holes in energetic asymmetric supernova explosions. Our Channel 2 example involves a modest supernova explosion that may leave behind a lower-gap to $\\sim$10 $M_{\\odot}$ black hole. The latter may not be easily distinguishable from ``standard\" supernovae that birth neutron stars. Our Channel 3 example experiences an aborted core-collapse explosion, more often in the context of a low-metallicity progenitor, whose residue is a black hole with a mass perhaps up to $\\sim$40 $M_{\\odot}$. The latter may be accompanied by a pulsational-pair instability supernova (PPISN). Channel 4 is the only quiescent or ``silent\" scenario for which perhaps $\\sim$5 to 15 $M_{\\odot}$ black holes are left. Where appropriate, we estimate $^{56}$Ni yields, explosion energies, approximate recoil speeds, and residual black hole masses. The progenitor mass density and binding energy profiles at collapse influence the outcome in a systematic way. We speculate that the statistics and prevalence of these various channels depend not only on still evolving supernova theory, but on remaining issues with the theory of massive star evolution, binary interaction, wind mass loss, metallicity, and the nuclear equation of state. Importantly, we suggest, but have not proven, that the silent channel for black hole formation may not be the dominant formation modality."

To trigger explosions in 1D, various numerical recipes have been applied, mostly with gross simplifications of the complex microphysics governing stellar core collapse, the formation of the compact remnant, and the mechanism of the explosion. Here we investigate the two most popular treatments, piston-driven and thermal-bomb explosions, in comparison to 1D explosions powered by a parametric neutrino engine in the P-HOTB code. For this comparison we calculate CCSNe for eight stars and evolution times up to 10,000 s, targeting the same progenitor-specific explosion energies as obtained by the neutrino-engine results. Otherwise we employ widely-used (\"classic\") modelling assumptions, and alternatively to the standard contraction-expansion trajectory for pistons, we also test suitably selected Lagrangian mass shells adopted from the neutrino-driven explosions as \"special trajectories.\" Although the 56Ni production agrees within roughly a factor of two between the different explosion triggers, neither piston nor thermal bombs can reproduce the correlation of 56Ni yields and explosion energies found in neutrino-driven explosions. This shortcoming as well as the problem of massive fallback witnessed in classical piston models, which diminishes or extinguishes the ejected nickel, can be largely cured by the special trajectories. These and the choice of the explosion energies, however, make the modelling dependent on pre-existing neutrino-driven explosion results."

The sensitivity of transport coefficients to the particle momentum dependence of the collision time scale of the microscopic interactions in the hot QCD medium is analyzed. For a conformal, number-conserving system, we compare the ERTA-modified transport coefficients for particle diffusion with exact results derived from scalar field theory. With an appropriate parameterization of the relaxation time, we demonstrate the consistency of our analysis and assess the degree of agreement of the results with the exact solutions from scalar field theory. The relaxation times for the shear and number diffusion evolution equations are seen to be distinct in general when the momentum dependence of the relaxation time is taken into consideration."

In general, neutron stars rotate rapidly and structure of neutron stars can be affected, especially in millisecond pulsars. To better constrain the nuclear EoS, it is important to describe neutron star structure taking into account the effects of rotation in a fully relativistic manner. Purpose: In this study, we investigate the internal structure of neutron stars under the influence of rotation. We explore correlations between rotational effects and EoS parameters, based on realistic calculations of rapidly rotating neutron stars based on the KEH method, which provides stable solutions for axially symmetric rotating equilibrium configurations. Results: Using 5 different Skyrme EoS parameter sets, we find that the maximum angular frequency achievable by rotating neutron stars, as calculated via the KEH method, varies depending on the stiffness of the equation of state. We confirm that an increase in the rotating frequency leads to an overall increase in both the mass and radius along the M-R curve. By performing calculations at two frequently referenced neutron stars, we further examine how the changes in mass and radius correlate with the nuclear matter properties at saturation density. Our results suggest that the 716Hz rotational constraint may require a more conservative interpretation when accounting for realistic stellar deformation effects. Conclusions: To place stringent constraints on the nuclear EoS based on observational data, it is sometimes essential to account for the effects of rotation in neutron star models. In particular, the influence of rotation becomes increasingly significant at higher spin frequencies and cannot be neglected in rapidly rotating systems with $>$400Hz."

In the current huge drive to forge quantum computers into complementary venues that are ideally suited to capture snapshots of far-from-equilibrium HEP dynamics, a major goal is to utilize these devices for scattering experiments. A major obstacle in this endeavor has been the hardware overhead required to access the late-time post-collision dynamics while implementing the underlying gauge symmetry. Here, we report on the first quantum simulation of scattering in a lattice gauge theory (LGT), performed on \\texttt{IBM}'s \\texttt{ibm\\_marrakesh} quantum computer. Specifically, we quantum-simulate the collision dynamics of electrons and positrons as well as mesons in a $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ LGT representing $1+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED), uncovering rich post-collision dynamics that we can precisely tune with a topological $\\Theta$-term and the fermionic mass. By monitoring the time evolution of the scattering processes, we are able to distinguish between two main regimes in the wake of the collision. The first is characterized by the delocalization of particles when the topological $\\Theta$-term is weak, while the second regime shows localized particles with a clear signature when the $\\Theta$-term is nontrivial. Furthermore, we show that by quenching to a small mass at the collision point, inelastic scattering occurs with a large production of matter reminiscent of quantum many-body scarring. Our work provides a major step forward in the utility of quantum computers for investigating the real-time quantum dynamics of HEP collisions."

We prepare well-separated single-particle wave packets with desired momentum-space wavefunctions, and simulate their collision through digitized time evolution. Multiple hadronic wave packets can be produced using the efficient, systematically improvable algorithm of this work, achieving high fidelity with the target initial state. Specifically, employing a trapped-ion quantum computer (IonQ Forte), we prepare up to three meson wave packets using 11 and 27 system qubits, and simulate collision dynamics of two meson wave packets for the smaller system. Results for local observables are consistent with numerical simulations at early times, but decoherence effects limit evolution into long times. We demonstrate the critical role of high-fidelity initial states for precision measurements of state-sensitive observables, such as $S$-matrix elements. Our work establishes the potential of quantum computers in simulating hadron-scattering processes in strongly interacting gauge theories."

The point of failure occurs at the use of the transposition rule, $\\delta(\\partial_\\nu A^\\mu)=\\partial_\\nu(\\delta A^\\mu)$, in the derivation of the equations of motion from the extremization of the action; we show that the transposition rule does not hold for general non-holonomic constraints.

The pure QED and electroweak contributions have been further consolidated, while hadronic contributions continue to be responsible for the bulk of the uncertainty of the SM prediction. Significant progress has been achieved in the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution using both the data-driven dispersive approach as well as lattice-QCD calculations, leading to a reduction of the uncertainty by almost a factor of two. The most important development since WP20 is the change in the estimate of the leading-order hadronic-vacuum-polarization (LO HVP) contribution. A new measurement of the $e^+e^-\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-$ cross section by CMD-3 has increased the tensions among data-driven dispersive evaluations of the LO HVP contribution to a level that makes it impossible to combine the results in a meaningful way. At the same time, the attainable precision of lattice-QCD calculations has increased substantially and allows for a consolidated lattice-QCD average of the LO HVP contribution with a precision of about 0.9\\%. Adopting the latter in this update has resulted in a major upward shift of the total SM prediction, which now reads $a_\\mu^\\text{SM} = 116\\,592\\,033(62)\\times 10^{-11}$ (530 ppb). When compared against the current experimental average based on the E821 experiment and runs 1-3 of E989 at Fermilab, one finds $a_\\mu^\\text{exp} - a_\\mu^\\text{SM} =26(66)\\times 10^{-11}$, which implies that there is no tension between the SM and experiment at the current level of precision. The final precision of E989 is expected to be around 140 ppb, which is the target of future efforts by the Theory Initiative. The resolution of the tensions among data-driven dispersive evaluations of the LO HVP contribution will be a key element in this endeavor."

Especially, one can infer the scattering length from fitting theory predictions for the shape of the distribution to experimental data. To obtain the distribution for the triton, we first solve the ground-state three-body problem using momentum-space Faddeev equations. Next, we include the neutron-neutron final-state interaction by applying the corresponding M{\\o}ller operator to the ground state. We present leading-order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) pionless effective field theory results with quantified uncertainties. At NLO, we include the effective ranges semi-perturbatively. We conclude, that pionless EFT works reliably as expected and that the neutron-neutron distribution of the triton shows a significant sensitivity to the scattering length."

We present a new treatment of the (Z,A) dependence of coherent muon-to-electron conversion in 236 isotopes. Our approach differs from previous treatments in several ways. Firstly, we include the effect of permanent quadrupole deformation on the charged lepton flavor violating matrix elements, using the method of Barrett moments. This method also enables the addition of muonic X-ray nuclear size and shape determinations of the charge distribution to the electron scattering results used previously. Secondly, we employ a Hartree-Bogoliubov model to calculate neutron-related matrix elements for even-even nuclei. This takes into account the quadrupole deformation of the neutron distributions and the fact that neutrons are, in general, in different shell model orbits than protons. The calculated conversion rates differ from previous calculations, particularly in the region of large permanent quadrupole deformation. Finally, we propose an alternative normalization of the muon-to-electron conversion rated, which related more closely to what a given experiment acturally measures, and better separate lepton physics from nuclear physics effects."

Large theoretical and phenomenological efforts have been dedicated thus far to assess the diffusion of charm and bottom quarks in the quark-gluon plasma and their subsequent hadronization into heavy-flavor (HF) hadrons. However, the fireball formed in heavy-ion collisions also features an extended hadronic phase, and therefore any quantitative analysis of experimental observables needs to account for the rescattering of charm and bottom hadrons. This is further reinforced by the presence of a QCD cross-over transition and the notion that the interaction strength is maximal in the vicinity of the pseudo-critical temperature. We review existing approaches for evaluating the interactions of open HF hadrons in a hadronic heat bath and the pertinent results for scattering amplitudes, spectral functions and transport coefficients. While most of the work to date has focused on $D$-mesons, we also discuss excited states as well as HF baryons and the bottom sector. Both the HF hadro-chemistry and bottom observables will play a key role in future experimental measurements. We also conduct a survey of transport calculations in heavy-ion collisions that have included effects of hadronic HF diffusion and assess its impact on various observables."

While the previous cycle of works on this topic focused on ultra-relativistic collisions at the top RHIC and different LHC energies, the current work addresses relativistic collisions at lower energies, specifically ranging from approximately 1 to 50 GeV per nucleon pair in the center-of-mass colliding system. The formation times for the initial state of dense matter in such collisions can be up to three orders of magnitude longer than those in ultra-relativistic collisions. This reflects a fundamentally different nature and formation process, particularly concerning the possible stages of initial state evolution, including thermalization (which may be only partial at very low collision energies), subsequent hydrodynamic expansion, and the final transition of matter evolution into a hadronic cascade. These stages, which are fully realized in ultra-relativistic reactions, can also occur within the energy range of BES RHIC, albeit with distinct time scales. This publication not only advances the theoretical development of iHKM (referred to, if necessary, as the extended version of integrated Hydrokinetic Model, iHKMe), but also provides examples of model applications for calculating observables. A systematic description across a wide range of experimental energies, which is preliminary yet quite satisfactory, for spectra, flow, and femtoscopy, will follow this work."

Our purpose is to propose a similar simple systematics of spontaneous neutron half lives, but in terms of the nuclear reduced radius ρ = κR ∼ A1/3Q1/2, characterizing the ‘neutral’ outgoing spherical Hankel wave. It turns out that the half life in emission of neutral particles is governed by the scaling law T ∼ ρ−2 ∼ A−2/3Q−1 for monopole transitions.

The formulation of the 3-body dynamics is based on the equations of motion method for identical fermions -- also denoted as quantum correlation dynamics -- and presented in detail. The on-shell 2-body collision integral is briefly reviewed and the on-shell 3-body collision integral is derived on the basis of the same two-body interaction in leading order. The resulting equations obey particle number as well as energy-momentum conservation. For a quantification of the relative impact of 3-body interactions we employ a model study for a homogeneous system in space in a finite box with periodic boundary conditions. We address spin-isospin symmetric nuclear matter systems with momentum distributions that are given by shifted Fermi spheres (without overlap) as encountered in the initial phase of nucleus-nucleus collisions after contact. The results for the relaxation times -- employing an effective 2-body interaction -- are compared to Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BUU) transport calculations in the continuum limit for the same bombarding energies and are found to agree on the level of a few percent. We find that the additional 3-body interactions reduce the relaxation times up to a factor of 3 at 130 A$\\cdot$MeV. Furthermore, it is shown in BUU transport calculations that an enhanced stopping by 3$\\leftrightarrow$3 collisions shows up in the angular distribution of energetic nucleons ($>$ 60 MeV) e.g. in central $^{97}_{45}Rh$ collisions at 40 A$\\cdot$MeV that lead to the formation of a compound nucleus. The angular distribution of the energetic nucleons changes from a slightly forward peaked angular distribution to a slightly sidewards peaked angular distribution which might be controlled experimentally."

By confronting with recent neutron star observation constraints, we find it possible to have the early phase transitions (PT) at low densities ($n_B \\leq 2n_0$) in a way consistent with existing neutron star observations. We also establish the upper limits of the PT strength for each chiral invariant mass in parity doublet model.

In the case of the $ppp$ correlation function, a first analysis was done where the hyperspherical adiabatic method was used to determine the $ppp$ wave function at different energies. Although the asymptotic behavior, antisymmetrization issues and the treatment of the Coulomb interaction were discussed in detail, the convergence properties of the adiabatic basis were studied at low energies around the formation of the correlation peak determined mainly by the $J^\\pi=1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$ three-body states. Since many and very precise data have been taken or are planned to be measured at energies beyond the peak, we present an analysis of the convergence characteristics of the basis as the energy of the process increases. We show that in order to describe correctly the correlation tail it is necessary to consider three-body states up to $J^\\pi=21/2^-$ whereas higher states can be considered as free. Once those states are incorporated solving the associate dynamical equations, the agreement with the experimental data is found to be excellent."

In particular, the shrunken trend of changes of charge radii along a long isotopic chain is intimately associated with the shell quenching effect. In this work, the systematic evolution of charge radii along the proton numbers $Z=8$, $10$, $12$, $14$, $18$ isotopes is investigated by a relativistic Hartree Bogoliubov model. A ansatz about neutron-proton correlation around Fermi surface is considered for describing the abnormal behavior of nuclear charge radii. Our results show that the neutron-proton pairing corrections around the Fermi surface lead to a sudden strengthening of the charge radii of these isotopic chains at $N=8$, 20 and 28, reflecting the fact that this correction enhances the shell closure across $N=8$, 20 and 28. The reproduction of the $N=14$ charge radius in the Mg isotopes is affected by the way in which pairing correlations are handled, with BCS theory overestimating the shell effect of $N=14$, and the Bogoliubov quasiparticle transformation suggests a stronger pairing correlation near the proton Fermi surface, which is more consistent with experimental results. An analysis of the deviations from the theoretical and available experimental data for the charge radii of the 24 selected even-even nuclei shows that the neutron-proton pairing correction around the Fermi surface has an improved effect on the calculation of the charge {radii} using the meson-exchange effective interactions, but it does not help to significantly improve the results calculated by the density-dependent effective interactions."

Current gravitational wave detectors have limited sensitivities at post-merger frequencies in the range [1.5, 4] kHz. Therefore, valuable inferences can only be made after combining information from multiple (BNS) events. Criswell et al. [Phys. Rev. D 107, 043021 (2023)] carries out an injection study to infer the radius posterior for a $1.6 M_{\\odot}$ NS by combining the information from injected BNS events via the hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) formulation. This formulation utilizes empirical relations that connect the peak frequency of the post-merger remnant with the chirp mass of the system, and the EoS proxy parameter $R_{1.6}$. In this work, we extend the HBI formulation to other EoS proxy parameters (i.e., the radius of (NS), $R_{1.X}$, with masses 1.2, 1.4, and 1.8 $M_{\\odot}$) and combine the four $R_{1.X}$ posteriors through the piecewise polytropic EoS model to obtain measurable constraints on the EoS of the NS. We show that the NS radii can be constrained to within $\\sim$1 km ( $\\sim$0.55 km) assuming uniform (astrophysical) prior on $R_{1.X}$ for injections in the A+ noise. We also study systematic biases in the analysis coming from the limitations of empirical relations."

This is done by carefully performing gradient expansion of the Dirac equation in the fluid-gravity background. Different contributions in the expansion are understood in terms of density matrices of the probe baryon and the medium. The resulting spectral functions indicate that the holographic baryonic is polarized as responses to fluid acceleration, shear stress and vorticity.

This study is thus one of its first kind, where the study of anisotropic flow coefficients for p-O and O-O collisions is presented using a hybrid hydrodynamics model.

The renormalized QMD allows analytical investigations of key quantities such as the zero-temperature diquark gap and the critical temperature for color superconductivity, ultimately reproducing the exact BCS relation in the high-density limit. We carry out the same analysis for different schemes of RG-consistent QMD models. We show that the RG-consistent approach yields a phase diagram and thermodynamic properties qualitatively similar to those of the renormalization model, provided both are embedded within a unified scheme that ensures consistent vacuum properties. In particular, both treatments recover the expected high-density features characterized by the BCS relation and the Stefan-Boltzmann limit. Our results highlight the relevance of renormalization and RG-consistent methods for accurately capturing the thermodynamics of QMD and related effective models with diquark degrees of freedom."

In this work, we explore the global hyperon spin polarization and the spin alignment of vector mesons corresponding to the strong magnetic field, baryonic chemical potential, and medium anisotropy.

The dark matter component of the star is modeled as a non-self-annihilating system of spin $1/2$ fermions at zero temperature and its equation of state as an ideal relativistic Fermi gas. The equilibrium configurations of these dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANS) are calculated by solving a generalization of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to the case where the system consists of two perfect fluids interacting solely through gravity.

This paper focuses on the enhanced nuclear electric dipole moment (EDM) and Schiff moment present in nuclei with octupole deformation (pear-shaped nuclei). These moments, which are proportional to the octupole deformation, have a collective nature and are large in the intrinsic frame that rotates with the nucleus. However, in a state with definite angular momentum and parity, $T$ and $P$ conservation forbid their expectation values in the laboratory frame, as nuclear rotation causes them to vanish. In nuclei with octupole deformation, close opposite-parity rotational states with identical spin are mixed by $T$,$P$-violating nuclear forces. This mixing polarises the nuclear axis along the nuclear spin, allowing moments from the intrinsic frame to manifest in the laboratory frame, provided the nuclear spin $I$ is sufficiently large. Using half-life data for $E1$ transitions from the NuDat database, we calculate the intrinsic nuclear EDM $d_{\\text{int}}$ for a range of nuclei theorised to exhibit octupole deformation. From these values, we independently estimate the intrinsic nuclear Schiff moment $S_{\\text{int}}$ and the octupole deformation parameter $\\beta_{3}$. Finally, we compare the magnitude of these collective moments in the laboratory frame with the contributions from valence nucleons, providing an estimate of the nuclear EDM and Schiff moment components unrelated to octupole deformation. The uncertainty of our estimates may exceed a factor of 10."

Recent studies suggest the transverse component of the vorticity field is responsible for the global spin polarization. In contrast, the longitudinal component of the vorticity field accounts for the local spin polarization. The local (longitudinal) spin polarization of $\\Lambda$-hyperons arises due to the anisotropic flows in the transverse plane, indicating a quadrupole pattern of the longitudinal vorticity along the beam direction. In this study, we derive a simple solution relating the longitudinal mean spin vector with the second-order anisotropic flow coefficient due to the thermal shear tensor for an ideal uncharged fluid in a longitudinal boost invariant scenario. The present study focuses on the local spin polarization of $\\Lambda$ and $\\bar{\\Lambda}$ in Au$+$Au and Pb$+$Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and 5.02 TeV, respectively. Further, we explore the azimuthal angle, centrality, and transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) dependence study of longitudinal spin polarization using hydrodynamic and transport models. All these models predict a maximum longitudinal spin polarization in mid-central collisions around 30-50 \\% centrality at $p_{\\rm T} \\approx$ 2.0 - 3.0 GeV/c. These findings on longitudinal spin polarization advocate the existence of a thermal medium in non-central heavy-ion collisions."

For the first time, we employ the axially deformed relativistic Hartree–Fock–Bogoliubov (D-RHFB) model with the effects of the continuum, pairing correlations and tensor force to achieve the 1/2+ ground state (g.s.) supporting 1n halo of 19C, which is a long-standing problem for theorists. Taking the structural D-RHFB as the inputs of the Glauber model, we can reproduce the 1n removal cross sections and the narrow longitudinal momentum distributions of the breakup reaction 19C + 9Be at both low-energy region 60, 70 MeV u−1 and high-energy region 700 MeV u−1, respectively. Furthermore, we clarify the dominant s-wave contribution to 1n halo from the reaction observables, while the possibility of 3/2+ for g.s. in 19C has been completely ruled out. Additionally, it is found that the continuum plays a crucial role in the formation of halo nucleus, whereas the tensor force carried by the π-meson coupling does not exert much effect on the halo extension."

We first explore the impact of Lorentz-violating parameters on key thermodynamic properties, including the Hawking temperature, entropy, and specific heat, demonstrating significant deviations from their Lorentz-symmetric counterparts. Our analysis reveals that the Lorentz-violating parameter b induces modifications in phase transitions and stability conditions, offering novel insights into black-hole thermodynamics. Additionally, the influence of Lorentz-symmetry breaking on gravitational lensing is examined using modifications to the Rindler-Ishak method, showing that these effects enhance the bending of light near compact objects. Our findings, derived within the framework of the Standard-Model Extension and bumblebee gravity models, suggest that Lorentz-violating corrections may lead to observable astrophysical phenomena, providing potential tests for deviations from Einstein's theory of relativity."

The typical systems O Sm, W with deformed target nuclei were analyzed. Nuclear imaginary potentials were obtained successfully by fitting the excitation functions within the single-channel and coupled-channel frameworks, respectively. A good reproduction at the energy range between sub- and above-barrier energy regions was achieved. Results show long-range imaginary-part potential at a wide energy region covering the Coulomb barrier, consistent with the strong absorption for well-deformed systems. This work is a preliminary attempt to bridge the gap between fusion and scattering and extract the deformation parameters in the whole energy range.

The coupled channel is ignored in the scattering analysis based on the observation that the energy levels computed from the and operators do not mix. The channel is not included either since the energy range explored in this study is well below its threshold. Our results indicate that the interaction in the single channel is repulsive, and the scattering length is determined to be fm, where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic."

In this formula, each graviton turns into a pair of collinear gluons."

Combining the predicted binding energies and the ratios from the Skyrme Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) code transformed harmoic oscilattor (HFBTHO) with the parameter set based on the Universal Nuclear Energy Density Funcitonal (UNEDF0), the possible magic numbers in super-heavy mass region were simultaneously studied.

Using the same Lagrangian PKA1, the D-RHFB and CI-RHF models demonstrate an excellent agreement with experimental data for the ground-state deformation and the low-lying excitation energies of 32Mg. Furthermore, a new insight into the nature of the island of inversion is implemented from the breaking of the pseudo-spin symmetry (PSS) in addition to the cross-shell excitation, both of which are essential to obtaining a stable deformation and rotational collectivity for 32Mg. In particular, the exchange degrees of freedom, such as the ρ-tensor coupling in PKA1, are shown to be essential in determining the configuration interactions and binding of the nucleus."

The astrophysical S-factor was measured in the energy range relevant to the astrophysical p-process, between = 2.26 ± 0.12 and 6.84 ± 0.03 MeV. The experimental results have been compared with theoretical predictions of Hauser-Feshbach statistical model calculations using TALYS-1.96. A calculated proton-optical potential was implemented to achieve better fitting, with different combinations of available nuclear level densities (NLDs) and γ-ray strength functions in TALYS-1.96. The calculations provided satisfactory agreement with the experimental results. The reaction rate was extrapolated using the calculated potential in TALYS-1.96 and compared with the values provided in the REACLIB database."

The equation of state (EoS) is modeled using a density-dependent relativistic mean-field framework, with stellar evolution characterized by changes in entropy and lepton fraction. Both nucleonic and hyperonic compositions are considered. Non-radial $f$- and $p_1$-mode oscillations are computed using both the Cowling approximation and full general relativity. Trapped neutrinos initially increase the error of the Cowling approximation for $f$-modes, which decreases during deleptonization and rises again in the cold phase. In contrast, $p_1$-mode errors peak during intermediate stages due to evolving pressure and density gradients. The emergence of hyperons modestly raises oscillation frequencies in both modes. Existing universal relations for $f$-mode frequency and damping time lack model independence for PNSs, motivating a more robust relation. In particular, our proposed universal relation involving the moment of inertia and $\\tilde{\\eta}$ shows strong agreement across all evolutionary phases, offering a temperature-sensitive, model-independent scaling for asteroseismology. Radial oscillations of a $1.4,M_\\odot$ PNS are also studied for different EoSs. Our results show that displacement ($\\xi$) and pressure perturbation ($\\eta$) profiles are highly sensitive to thermal state, composition, and compactness. Hyperonic stars show higher frequencies, altered node structures, and stronger pressure perturbations due to EoS softening. Differences in frequency separation $\\Delta \\nu_n$ and fundamental frequency $\\nu_0$ between nucleonic and hyperonic models provide clear observational diagnostics for probing PNS interiors and constraining the dense matter EoS."

In this Letter, we report the first next-to-leading-order prediction of the nn \\rightarrow ppee amplitude, with Bayesian uncertainty quantification. This is made possible by the development of the relativistic chiral effective field theory, in which no unknown contact term is required up to next-to-leading order. The theory is validated by reproducing in a parameter-free way the available data on the charge independence and charge symmetry breaking contributions in the two-nucleon scattering.

It is usually assumed that the flavor composition is locally fixed during the formation of the first seed of deconfined quark matter since weak interaction acts too slowly to re-equilibrate flavors. However, the matter composition fluctuates around its average equilibrium values at the typical temperatures of high-energy astrophysical processes. Here, we extend our previous two-flavor nucleation formalism to a three-flavor case. We develop a thermodynamic framework incorporating finite-size effects and thermal fluctuations of local composition to compute the nucleation probability as the product of droplet formation and composition fluctuation rates. Moreover, we discuss the role of color-superconductivity in nucleation, arguing that it can play a role only in systems larger than the typical coherence length of diquark pairs. We found that thermal fluctuations of the matter composition lead to lowering the potential barrier between the metastable hadronic phase and the stable quark phase. Moreover, the formation of diquark pairs reduces the critical radius and thus the potential barrier in the low baryon density and temperature regime."

It is shown that if the mass-radius curve always has a negative slope the probability that the star has hyperons is very small. A very small probability of the presence of hyperons can already be identified by a negative slope for low-mass stars. A positive slope at $M/M_{\\odot} = 1.4$, could indicate the possible presence of hyperons. Nucleonic EoS are found to be more probable than hyperonic ones, given the GW170817 and NICER observation constraints for PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, and the highest probability is associated with nucleonic stars that originate a mass radius curve with positive slope. Mass-radius curves with a positive slope greater than 1.8$M_\\odot$ are not expected to occur. The nuclear matter property that most distinguishes the different scenarios is the curvature of the symmetry energy, with nucleonic EoS with positive slope predicting the highest values that can go above 100 MeV."

Recent progress in hypernuclear physics, driven by advanced experimental techniques and theoretical innovations, is briefly reviewed with a focus on key findings and unresolved challenges, such as the precise determination of the hypertriton binding energy, investigations of charge symmetry breaking in mirror hypernuclei, and the search for exotic systems, including the neutral nn$\\Lambda$ state. Experimental breakthroughs, including invariant-mass analyses and femtoscopy studies in heavy-ion collisions, as well as high-resolution $\\gamma$-spectroscopy, have enabled precise studies of light hypernuclei and offered critical insights into the hyperon-nucleon interaction. Theoretical progress, including ab initio calculations based on chiral effective field theory and lattice QCD, has further enhanced our understanding of hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions."

These characteristics are typically represented by a relative emission source and can be obtained using transport model simulations such as the Boltzmann- Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BUU) transport model. In this paper, we utilize the BUU transport model to simulate the p-p source. Subsequently, we integrate this source and the p-p kernel within the KP formula to calculate the correlations. By comparing the correlations obtained from the BUU simulation with those obtained using imaging methods, such as the deblurring method, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of fast and slow emissions on the measured correlations. Specifically, this comparison is used as a tool to determine a function (tail) that represents the relative distribution of the particle pair from secondary decay emissions. Thus, we correct the BUU source function by incorporating a tail to account for the contribution of secondary decay emissions, which cannot be accurately captured by BUU simulations. Resulting source function reproduces the features in the measured correlations. To illustrate our approach, we examine p-p correlations measured in Ar + Sc reactions at E/A = 80 MeV, considering both momentum-independent and momentum-dependent nuclear equations of state (EOS)."

We propose a three-regime picture using a hadron resonance gas (HRG) description augmented with the glueball spectrum based on the analysis of a large number, $N_c$, of colors. We estimate the entropy density from our model to confirm that the lattice-QCD data are bracketed with three regimes, i.e., a hadron gas, a QGP, and a new phase for $T_c \\lesssim T \\lesssim T_d$. In this new phase that we name a Spaghetti of Quarks with Glueballs (SQGB), thermal degrees of freedom of quarks are deconfined, yet gluons remain confined in glueballs. Since the Hagedorn temperature, $T_H\\sim 285\\;\\text{MeV}$, is universal in the meson and the glueball sectors, in the infinite $N_c$ limit, the phase diagram in the plane of the baryon chemical potential and the temperature is reduced to the one with the confined and deconfined phases and Quarkyonic Matter at high density. At large but finite $N_c$, an SQGB window may open between these phases. We point out that the SQGB has interesting similarities with Quarkyonic Matter and that this matter in the large $N_c$ limit is confined as measured by the interaction between heavy quarks, but behaves in other respects like a quasi-free gas of quarks. As a result of the extrapolation to $N_c=3$, we present a revised phase diagram with the SQGB phase bounded by thermal crossovers. Finally, we give a quantitative analysis of chiral symmetry restoration in the SQGB phase."

While the original Kogut-Susskind approach faces significant implementation challenges on quantum hardware, we show that it emerges naturally as the infinite scalar mass limit of the orbifold lattice formulation, even at finite lattice spacing. Our analysis provides both a general analytical framework applicable to SU($N$) gauge theories in arbitrary dimensions and specific numerical evidence for $(2+1)$-dimensional SU($N$) Yang-Mills theories ($N=2,3$). Using Euclidean path integral methods, we quantify the convergence rate by comparing the standard Wilson action with the orbifold lattice action, matching lattice parameters, and systematically extrapolating results as the bare scalar mass approaches infinity.

Viscous modified dilepton rate is calculated using the first-order Chapman-Enskog (CE) like non-equilibrium correction of the particle distribution function. Our study indicates that lower values of $q$ result in the enhancement of the emitted dilepton spectra.

We show that a modified formula in which the difference of integrated correlation functions between particles interacting with Coulomb plus short-range interaction and with Coulomb interaction alone is free of divergence, and has rapid approach to its infinite volume limit.

Specifically, we study the influence of nonperturbative effects and weak anisotropies on the heavy quark transport coefficients, taking into account the angular dependence between the anisotropy vector and the direction of heavy quark motion. Furthermore, the calculated drag and diffusion coefficients are employed to estimate the energy loss of heavy quarks and the nuclear modification factor, incorporating both elastic collisions and inelastic processes.

Many of these nuclei are located at or near the semi-magic nucleon numbers, mostly for protons. For example, 88 MR bands are currently known for the Pb (Z=82) nuclei, and 29 AMR band in Pd, Cd and In nuclei. It is interesting that the proton magic numbers appear to play a major role in the MR phenomenon, which seems less well understood. A brief discussion of the salient features of the MR and AMR bands and their theoretical interpretation has been presented in the present review. The tables contain gamma-ray energies, associated level energies with spins and parities, level lifetimes, B(M1), B(E2), and B(M1)/B(E2) ratios and probable spherical quasiparticle configurations. We find that many bands claimed in the literature as MR and AMR bands still have tentative assignments, as level lifetimes, thus B(M1) and B(E2) values, for a large number of MR and AMR bands, which can potentially provide critical criteria for firm identification of such structures, are lacking. Additionally, theoretical model calculations for many of these bands, which could provide insight for a better description of nuclear structure, are also lacking in literature.

In symmetric binaries, we describe a characteristic increase of the dominant postmerger gravitational-wave (GW) frequency by a few per cent, which is specifically linked to the occurrence of hyperons and can thus be potentially used as a discriminator between purely nucleonic and hyperonic systems. We corroborate that this effect occurs similarly for asymmetric binaries and becomes more prominent with increasing total binary mass. Hyperonic models tend to stick out in relations between the dominant postmerger GW frequency and the tidal deformability of massive stars providing a signature to identify the presence of hyperons. Distinct secondary postmerger GW spectral features are differently affected by the presence of hyperons, in the sense that one feature exhibits a characteristic frequency shift due to the specific thermal properties of hyperonic EoSs while the other does not. The dynamical mass ejection of mergers is tentatively enhanced for hyperonic models in comparison to nucleonic EoSs which yield roughly the same stellar properties of cold NSs. This may serve useful to identify exotic degrees of freedom in these systems by kilonova observations. Also, for hyperonic EoSs the threshold mass for prompt black hole formation is reduced by about 0.05 $M_{\\odot}$ in comparison to nucleonic systems with the same stellar parameters of cold NSs."

Three forms of LDPs were fitted: the liquid-drop model (LDM), the droplet model (DM), and the power-law dependence on mass number A. Additionally, the root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of the new LDPs and existing literature values were calculated. The newly fitted global LDM-type parameters outperform the commonly used Toke-Swiatecki parameters in various statistical model calculations. In contrast, neither the global nor the combined DM-type parameters yielded satisfactory results. Among the tested parameter sets, the widely adopted Reisdorf parameters exhibited the best overall performance, as evidenced by the larger number of experimental data points falling within their narrower RMSD confidence intervals. For the power-law A-dependence, the new global parameters performed better than the existing homogeneous ones. The ground-state deformation and isospin correction factors had minimal overall impact on the LDP fits. However, the current results suggest that theoretical calculations for transitional nuclei should account for ground-state deformation effects."

The calculated matter radii show excellent agreement with values extracted from low-energy proton and electron elastic scattering data, but are inconsistent with those derived from interaction cross sections and charge-changing cross section measurements.

In exploring this region, identification of nuclei with relatively longer half-life as compared to its neighbours is crucial for experimental studies. Such information is provided from theoretical predictions, which are however, heavily dependent on the theoretical model used and observable quantities under investigation.\n  Purpose: Limiting ourselves to the Skyrme Hartree-Fock-plus-Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer approach, we aimed to analyse the appearance of a nuclear region with relatively high stability associated with emergence of spherical and deformed magic numbers in the region of $170 \\le N \\le 190$ ($112 \\le Z \\le 130$) based on various observables.\n  Methods: Three Skyrme parametrizations namely the SkM* frequently employed for fission calculations, and the SLy5 and SLy4 commonly used for superheavy region, are considered to provide comparisons within the Skyrme mean-field approach. We evaluated the variation of electric quadrupole deformation ($\\beta_{20}$), binding energy per nucleon ($BE/A$), two-nucleon separation energy differential ($\\delta S2_{q}$), alpha-decay energy ($Q_{\\alpha}$) and alpha-decay half-lives ($T_{1/2}$).\n  Conclusion: Our analyses suggest that neutron number $N = 178$ is candidate for deformed magic number around proton number $114 \\le Z \\le 118$. For protons, $Z = 120$ and $124$ appears to be a candidate for deformed magic number at around $N = 172 \\sim 178$. Both sets of deformed magic numbers appear at oblate ground-state deformation."

We compare Variational Perturbation Theory (VPT) to ordinary many-body perturbation theory and the inversion method, all to second order in their respective expansions, and verify issues with Hubbard-Stratonovich auxiliary fields.

Our analysis has demonstrated that while all considered CEDF models broadly reproduce current astrophysical and theoretical constraints, subtle yet important differences persist among them, with each framework exhibiting distinct characteristics at supra-nuclear density. This is in particular true for the proton fraction inside neutron stars, but also supported by the models' behavior with respect to the pure neutron matter EOS and the density dependence of the speed of sound.

However, preparing accurate non-trivial initial states for these simulations is challenging. Classical Euclidean-time Monte-Carlo methods provide a wealth of information about states of interest to quantum simulations. Thus, it is desirable to facilitate state preparation on quantum simulators using this information. To this end, we present a fully classical pipeline for generating efficient quantum circuits for preparing the ground state of an interacting scalar field theory in 1+1 dimensions. The first element of this pipeline is a variational ansatz family based on the stellar hierarchy for bosonic quantum systems. The second element of this pipeline is the classical moment-optimization procedure that augments the standard variational energy minimization by penalizing deviations in selected sets of ground-state correlation functions (i.e., moments). The values of ground-state moments are sourced from classical Euclidean methods. The resulting states yield comparable ground-state energy estimates but exhibit distinct correlations and local non-Gaussianity. The third element of this pipeline is translating the moment-optimized ansatz into an efficient quantum circuit with an asymptotic cost that is polynomial in system size. This work opens the way to systematically applying classically obtained knowledge of states to prepare accurate initial states in quantum field theories of interest in nature."

The effective degrees of freedom are scalars, pseudo-scalars, diquarks, and quarks. The parameters in the scalar/pseudo-scalar sector can be determined by matching the meson pole masses and decay constants to their observed values using the on-shell renormalization scheme. The remaining parameters are in the diquark sector and a priori unknown. In principle, they can be calculated from QCD, but we consider them free. We renormalize the thermodynamic potential in the 2SC phase for two flavors and in the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase for three flavors, determining the counterterms of the couplings in the diquark sector. We derive a set of renormalization group equations for these couplings that are used to improve the thermodynamic potential. As an application, we calculate the gap and the speed of sound in the ideal CFL phase. It is shown that the gap approaches a constant as $\\mu_B\\rightarrow\\infty$ and that the speed of sound relaxes to the conformal limit from above."

Our results show that as the DM fraction increases, the maximum gravitational mass of the NS decreases, especially for heavier DM particles, while lighter DM particles can induce a transition from a dark core to a halo structure, increasing the maximum mass. Strong MFs soften the equation of state and reduce the dark mass a NS core can retain before transitioning to a halo. By comparing our results with observations from Neutro Star Interior Composition Explorer and GW170817, we identify the possible range of DM parameters for these objects. We find that the magnetic field slightly changes these limits, mainly affecting the maximum NS mass and tidal deformability. These findings provide key insights into how DM and MF jointly shape the mass-radius relation and the stability of DM-admixed magnetized NSs."

By combining the light-front quark model (LFQM) with the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model, which reasonably reproduces EMFFs in free space and the saturation properties of nuclear matter, respectively, we systematically analyze the in-medium EMFFs and charge radii of mesons with various quark flavors. Our findings show that the EMFFs of charged (neutral) mesons exhibit a faster fall-off (increase) with increasing four-momentum transfer squared and nuclear density. Consequently, the absolute value of the charge radii of mesons increases with nuclear density, where the rate of increase depends on their quark flavor contents. We observe that the EMFFs of pions and kaons undergo significant modifications in the nuclear medium, while heavy-light mesons are only slightly modified. By decomposing the quark flavor contributions to EMFFs, we show that the medium effects primarily impact the light-quark sector, leaving the heavy-quark sector nearly unaffected. The results of this study further suggest the importance of the medium effects at the quark level."

Semi-empirical nuclear level densities (NLD), which are obtained by combining experimental data in the excitation-energy region below the neutron binding energy and the back-shifted Fermi gas model prediction for the high excitation-energy up to 250 MeV, are utilized to determine the CE partition function. Results obtained show that two phase transitions can appear in 160−164Dy isotopes, namely the pairing phase transition and the shape phase transition. The pairing phase transition is found to be of first-order and its critical temperature is ∼0.5 MeV, while the shape phase transition is found to be also of first-order but it occurs at higher temperatures, i.e. around 2.2–2.5 MeV. A comparison between this work and previous ones that involve the same classification scheme but employ purely theoretical NLD has shown a considerable inconsistency. However, our findings should be more conclusive due to various supports from previous theoretical and experimental studies."

The Faddeev equations are explicitly formulated without imposing symmetry or antisymmetry requirements on the two-body t-matrices, thus accounting for mass differences between the three interacting particles. An algorithm for the algebraic determination of non-relativistic wave functions for three-body systems with arbitrary masses is given. Furthermore, it is directly demonstrated how the domain of logarithmic singularities in the integral kernels of the Faddeev equations is significantly altered by varying the masses of the interacting particles. The developed method for traversing logarithmic singularities is tested using the example of calculating the total cross sections for elastic neutron-deuteron scattering and breakup reaction."

It is interesting to study local fluctuations of a specific particle specie, e.g. baryons, in the transverse plane. Fluctuations of the harmonic flow provide an integrated measure of such fluctuations. An alternative approach is to study proton number fluctuations measured in a relatively narrow azimuthal angle window. Due to the transverse flow, particles registered in a narrow azimuthal angle window are emitted predominantly from a region of the fireball located at the same azimuthal angle. Similarly, it is informative to measure the covariance of the number of protons emitted in two opposite windows of azimuthal angles. The main difficulty lies in distinguishing effects of local baryon density fluctuations in the transverse plane from global particle density and collective flow fluctuations. These global volume and flow fluctuations can be estimated using some reference particles, e.g. charged mesons. Reliable estimates of such fluctuations can be constructed both for the second factorial cumulant of the proton number in an azimuthal angle window and for the covariance between two such windows. The simultaneous measurement of both quantities provides a sensitive probe of local baryon number fluctuations superimposed on top of a fluctuating fireball background density."

We show that all permutationally-invariant unitaries on an arbitrary number of qubits can be realized using this permutationally-invariant Hamiltonian, which couples the qubits to an oscillator initialized in its vacuum state, together with global uniform x and z fields on all qubits. This includes useful gates, such as controlled-Z gate with an arbitrary number of control qubits. As a corollary, we find that all permutationally invariant states -- including useful entangled states such as GHZ and Dicke states -- can be prepared using this interaction and global fields. We also characterize unitaries that can be realized on the joint Hilbert space of the qubits and oscillator with the TC interaction and global z field, and develop new methods for preparing the state of the oscillator in an arbitrary initial state. We present various examples of explicit circuits for the case of n=2 qubits.

      "summary": "arXiv:2506.03782v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Event classifiers are the most fundamental observables to probe the system size and event topology of high-energy collisions. Significant progress has been made to establish suitable event classifiers to probe different physics processes occurring in elementary $e^{+}e^{-}$ to heavy-ion collisions in a range of center of mass energies. One of the major motivations to revisit event classifiers at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) originates from the recent measurements of high multiplicity proton-proton collisions, which have revealed that these small collision systems exhibit features similar to the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), traditionally believed to be only achievable in heavy nucleus-nucleus collisions at ultra-relativistic energies. To pinpoint the origin of these QGP-like phenomena with substantially reduced auto-correlation and selection biases, and to bring all collision systems on equal footing, along with charged-particle multiplicity, lately several event topology classifiers such as transverse sphericity, transverse spherocity, relative transverse activity classifier, and charged-particle flattenicity have been used extensively in experiments as well as in the phenomenological front. In this review article, we extensively discuss the purpose, coverage, and usage guidelines of these event shape classifiers, which can be crucial given the upcoming measurements in a precision era during Runs 3 and 4 of the LHC. In most cases, the event shape observables are found to be better probes in understanding the heavy-ion-like behavior seen at the LHC, while making a multi-differential study of multihadron production dynamics in hadronic and nuclear collisions."

In the original SuSAM model, a universal scaling function was fitted to a selected set of quasielastic electron scattering (e,e') cross section data, using a phenomenological ansatz inspired by the Relativistic Mean Field model of nuclear matter. In this work, we refine the procedure by first fitting a longitudinal scaling function directly to experimental longitudinal response data. Subsequently, a separate transverse scaling function is extracted from purely transverse data, after subtracting the longitudinal contribution already determined. We find that the resulting transverse scaling function must exhibit an explicit dependence on the momentum transfer q in order to reproduce all kinematics consistently. The resulting SuSAM-v2 model simultaneously describes inclusive quasielastic cross sections and both longitudinal and transverse response functions in electron scattering. The model is then applied to neutrino-nucleus scattering, showing an improved prediction compared to the previous SuSAM-v1 version, due to a more accurate treatment of the relative contributions of the longitudinal and transverse weak nuclear responses."

Taking into account the quark substructure of baryons, we argue that the saturation of quark states occurs at $\\sim$ 2-3$n_0$, driving quark matter formation even before baryonic cores of radius $\\sim$0.5 fm spatially overlap. We describe the continuous transitions from hadronic to quark matter within a quarkyonic matter model in which gluons are assumed to remain confining at densities of interest.

The increase in computational power has naturally led to new applications of mean-field (and beyond) methods. This is particularly the case of quasi-fission reactions. Since the first edition, significant progress has also been made in treating pairing correlations dynamically, leading to realistic applications in multi-nucleon transfer, fusion and fission reactions. A new section has been added on fission dynamics. A summary of recent researches on nuclear dynamics with realistic microscopic quantum approaches is presented. The Balian-Veneroni variational principle is used to derive the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) equation describing the dynamics at the mean-field level, as well as an extension including small-amplitude quantum fluctuations which is equivalent to the time-dependent random-phase approximation (TDRPA). Such formalisms as well as their practical implementation in the nuclear physics framework with modern three-dimensional codes are discussed. Recent applications to nuclear dynamics, from collective vibrations to heavy-ion collisions are presented. A particular attention is devoted to the interplay between collective motions and internal degrees of freedom. For instance, the harmonic nature of collective vibrations is questioned. Large amplitude collective motions are investigated in the framework of heavy-ion collisions and fission. How fusion is affected by the internal structure of the collision partners, such as their deformation, is discussed. Other mechanisms in competition with fusion, and responsible for the formation of fragments which differ from the entrance channel (transfer reactions, deep-inelastic collisions, and quasi-fission) are investigated. Finally, studies of actinide collisions forming, during very short times of few zeptoseconds, the heaviest nuclear systems available on Earth, are presented."

At high energies, the bound is compared with proton-proton scattering data; at low energies, with numerical bootstrap results obtained by directly maximizing the cross-section. We conjecture that the amplitude saturating the cross-section at high energies lies at a strongly-coupled corner of the allowed space of low-energy parameters. This universal amplitude exhibits a rising total cross-section, a shrinking elastic differential cross-section with multiple diffractive minima, and a surprisingly rich spectrum of resonances aligning along Regge trajectories, including Pomeron-like and daughter trajectories, as well as unusual ``singular\" trajectories in the forward limit which appear deeply interconnected with Froissart growth. Remarkably, the eikonal representation reveals that the scattering is localized within an annular region that slowly expands with energy, challenging the traditional ``disk\" diffraction picture.

Determining the character and manifestations of QCD is one of the most important and challenging outstanding issues necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the structure of hadrons. Within the context of the QCD parton picture, the parton distribution functions (PDFs) have been remarkably successful in describing a wide variety of processes. However, these PDFs have generally been confined to the description of collinear partons within the hadron. New experiments and facilities provide the opportunity to additionally explore the three-dimensional structure of hadrons, which can be described by generalized parton distributions (GPDs), for example. In recent years, a breakthrough was made in calculating the Bjorken-$x$ dependence of PDFs in lattice QCD by using large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) and other similar frameworks. The breakthrough has led to the emergence and rapid development of direct calculations of Bjorken-$x$--dependent structure. In this review article, we show some of the recent progress made in lattice QCD in PDFs and GPDs and discuss future challenges."

The effective theory is based on the baryon sector dynamical spin-flavor $SU(4)$ symmetry emergent in the large $N_c$ limit, whose breaking in controlled by the $1/N_c$ expansion. The non-commutativity of the chiral and $1/N_c$ expansions in unitarity corrections (loops) requires a linking of both expansions. As it was shown in the case of baryon masses and currents, the natural linking is the $\\xi$-expansion, in which ${\\cal{O}}(p)={\\cal{O}}(1/N_c)={\\cal{O}}(\\xi)$. The spin-flavor symmetry requires that the ground state baryons span an $SU(4)$ symmetric irreducible representation which implies that in particular $N$ and $\\Delta$ are active degrees of freedom in the effective theory.\n  The scattering amplitude is expanded to the next-to-next to leading order in the $\\xi$ expansion, corresponding to the one-loop contributions with the LO Lagrangian. The results are given for generic $N_c$ in order to demonstrate the consistency of the framework. The spin-flavor symmetry plays a central role in maintaining the consistency of the effective theory with respect to the $1/N_c$ expansion. This consistency manifests itself in an improvement in the convergence of the low energy expansion with respect to the case of the ordinary BChPT without an explicit dynamical $\\Delta$, which is known to be inconsistent the constraints of $N_c$ scaling.\n  Fits to the $\\pi N\\to \\pi N$ S, P and D partial wave amplitudes from the SAID data base are finally used to test the framework and to determine the energy range of its applicability."

Our expansion can be used to describe neutron star mergers using the equation of state inferred from neutron star observations. We discuss how knowledge from low-energy nuclear experiments and heavy-ion collisions can be directly incorporated into the expansion. We also suggest new thermodynamic quantities of interest that can be calculated from theoretical models or directly inferred by experimental data that can be used to infer the finite temperature equation of state. With our new method, we can quantify the uncertainty in our finite $T$ and $Y_Q$ expansions without making assumptions about the underlying degrees of freedom. We can reproduce results from a microscopic equation of state up to $T=100$ MeV for baryon chemical potential $\\mu_B\\gtrsim 1100$ MeV ($\\sim1-2 \\ n_{\\rm sat}$) within $5\\%$ error, with even better results for larger $\\mu_B$ and/or lower $T$.

The motion of the spin is explicitly considered using the spin canonical variables derived by semiclassical approximation to the spin coherent state path integral representation. In addition to the diametric and two circular PO families with frozen spin, solutions that bridge two circular POs are found in which orbital motion is coupled to spin precession. In addition, each bridge encounters a secondary bifurcation on the way from one circular PO to the other and generates a new PO, that survives at higher energies while maintaining a constant period. The generic expressions for those POs are obtained explicitly, and all the above peculiar bifurcation scenarios are described fully analytically."

These states may also be influenced by new high-scale, weakly interacting physics. Incorporating right-handed neutrinos into an effective field theory framework -the νSMEFT- offers a systematic approach to study the phenomenology of heavy neutrinos in current and upcoming experiments. In this work, we present the first prospective 95% exclusion plots achievable at a future lepton collider operating at a center-of-mass energy of for what we term the agnostic νSMEFT scenario. This study focuses on the high-mass regime where the heavy neutrino N decays promptly into leptons and jets. Specifically, we analyse the processes e+e− → νN → νμ−μ+ν and e+e− → νN → νμ−jj, deriving the exclusion regions in the versus mN parameter space. When compared to prospective limits for the LHeC, we find that the semi-leptonic process with final jets in a lepton collider offers the greatest sensitivity, even with a straightforward cut-based analysis. The expected bounds are as stringent as those considered in recent studies for the low-mass regime where the N may be long-lived and detectable via displaced decay searches, both at the LHC and future colliders."

Consequently, the $G'_0$ is closely related to the Gamow-Teller resonance (GTR), the beta and double-beta decay rates of finite nuclei, the spin response of hot and dense nucleonic matter that determines the neutrino-nucleon reaction rates in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, and finally the critical density for pion condensation in neutron stars. Historically, the $G'_0$ was obtained by fitting the peak location of experimental GTR spectra by using phenomenological pion exchange models, without strict uncertainty quantification. In this letter, for the first time, we report the Bayesian inference of $G'_0$ by using a self-consistent Skyrme Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation (QRPA) model and joint constraints from experimental GTR measurements on $^{208}\\mathrm{Pb}$, $^{132}\\mathrm{Sn}$, $^{90}\\mathrm{Zr}$. Our extracted $G_0'$ is $0.48\\pm0.034$, which is close to the prediction of a few existing Skyrme models that consider the spin-isospin observables but is smaller than the extracted ones from pion-exchange models. We hint to possible reasons for this deviation, like the value of the nucleon effective mass $\\frac{m^*}{m}$. Finally, we demonstrate the influence of $G'_0$ on neutrino opacities in CCSNe and BNS mergers. The new Skyrme parameterizations from our Bayesian study may also be used to study other spin-isospin-dependent phenomena."

However, standard phenomenological EoS models often rely on heuristic extrapolations in the low-density regime, which are inconsistent with microscopic predictions. In this work, we refine a unified meta-modeling framework for the EoS by incorporating low-density corrections based on energy density functionals constrained by ab initio neutron-matter calculations. Using Bayesian inference to combine information from astrophysical observations, nuclear theory, and experiments, we assess the impact of these corrections on key crustal properties, including the crust-core transition density and pressure, crustal composition, and moment of inertia. The improved model reduces uncertainties in the inner crust and emphasizes the importance of low-density physics in EoS modeling, highlighting the value of integrating both theoretical and observational constraints across densities to robustly describe the EoS. Moreover, the adopted approach can be readily applied to any existing EoS model to provide a solid framework for interpreting upcoming high-precision multimessenger data."

Recent studies at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have shown that several observables, such as the collective flow and transverse-momentum correlations of the produced particles, can be sensitive to various nuclear structure and deformation parameters. Femtoscopy, another essential tool for investigating the space-time geometry of the matter created in nuclear collisions, has not yet been widely applied to such studies. Using a multiphase transport model (AMPT), in this Letter, it is demonstrated that the femtoscopic source parameters of pion pairs can also serve as a robust signal of unique nuclear structure. Through an analysis of $^{208}$Pb+$^{20}$Ne and $^{208}$Pb+$^{16}$O collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}$ = 68.5 GeV, two collision systems especially relevant to the SMOG2 program of the LHCb experiment, it is shown that a deformed initial shape can significantly affect femtoscopic source parameters. This study highlights the importance of expanding the nuclear structure investigations to femtoscopic observables and serves as a baseline for numerous possible future studies in this new direction."

The model equations of state used in this study have phase transitions strong enough to induce a gravitational instability that terminates the sequence of stable neutron stars. These equations of state also admit a second sequence of stable stars with core matter that has undergone this strong first-order phase transition (possibly driven by quark deconfinement). These results indicate that spectral representations generally achieve somewhat higher accuracy than piecewise analytic representations having the same number of parameters. Both types of representation show power-law convergence at approximately the same rate."

These pairs cause spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, a fundamental phenomenon that is believed to generate over 99% of the mass in the visible universe. However, the precise mechanism linking the chiral symmetry breaking to the mass generation associated with quark confinement remains one of the most profound open questions in physics. Here, we investigate high energy proton-proton collisions at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where those collisions could liberate virtual quark-antiquark pairs from the vacuum. These virtual pairs, particularly the strange quark-antiquark pairs, are initially quantum spin-entangled and later undergo quark confinement to form hadrons such as $\\Lambda$ hyperons. In this Letter, we report the first evidence of spin correlation of $\\Lambda\\bar{\\Lambda}$ hyperon pairs measured by the STAR experiment at RHIC - a relative polarization signal of $(18 \\pm 4)\\%$ that links the spin-entangled quark pairs of the Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) vacuum to their final-state hadron counterparts. Crucially, this correlation vanishes when the hyperon pairs are widely separated in angle, consistent with the decoherence of the quantum system. Our findings provide a new experimental paradigm for exploring the dynamics and interplay of quark confinement and entanglement."

Excitation energies and spin-parities were determined for several states, including two unobserved resonances at $E_r$ $=$ $18.7$~keV and $E_r$ $=$ $50.5$~keV. The angular correlation analysis enabled the first unambiguous determination of the orbital angular momentum transfer for these states. These results provide a significant update to the $^{30}$Si(p,$\\gamma$)$^{31}$P thermonuclear reaction rate, with direct implications for models of nucleosynthesis in globular clusters and other astrophysical sites.

Electrons, neutrinos, and up and down quarks are distributed across two lattice sites and mapped to 32 qubits, with an additional 4 qubits used for flag-based error mitigation. A four-fermion interaction is used to implement weak interactions, and lepton-number violation is induced by a neutrino Majorana mass. Quantum circuits that prepare the initial nucleus and time evolve with the Hamiltonian containing the strong and weak interactions are executed on IonQ Forte Enterprise. A clear signal of neutrinoless double-$\\beta$ decay is measured, making this the first quantum simulation to observe lepton-number violation in real time. This was made possible by co-designing the simulation to maximally utilize the all-to-all connectivity and native gate-set available on IonQ's quantum computers. Quantum circuit compilation techniques and co-designed error-mitigation methods, informed from executing benchmarking circuits with up to 2,356 two-qubit gates, enabled observables to be extracted with high precision.

Simulations are performed with six degenerate fermion flavors and a range of $\\beta$ values that span the phase boundary. Center vortices are demonstrated to capture the broken shift symmetry that manifests in the unphysical phase. This persists at the level of each individual plaquette orientation, where it is revealed only the plaquettes that span the broken dimension are affected. Several bulk center-vortex quantities, including the vortex and branching point densities, are considered to highlight other aspects of vortex geometry sensitive to the unphysical phase. A slight preference for the plaquettes affected by the broken shift symmetry to be pierced by a vortex is observed. This translates also to a greater branching point density in three-dimensional slices that span the broken dimension. Combined, these findings provide a novel characterization of the unphysical phase in terms of the fundamental center degrees of freedom."

Despite the large difference, the derived reaction rates are illustrated to be concordant with the current evaluated rates for $0.08 \\le T_9 \\le 3$. The difference below $E=0.20$ MeV can be seen in the rates for $T_9 \\le 0.07$. In comparison with the calculations, the rates are found to be reduced by about 10$^{-4}$ at $T_9=0.05$, because of an accurate description for $^8$Be break-up. Uncertainties of the rates are also estimated by examining sensitivity to 3$\\alpha$ potentials. With introducing three-body $S$-factors and a resonant term, the present rates are expressed in an analytic form, and they are provided in a tabular form for astrophysical applications. To update the evaluated rates, non-resonant sequential process between $\\alpha+^8$Be could be deleted by hand.

The analysis of energy conditions reveals deviations from standard GR, with PFDM affecting the weak and strong energy conditions. The study further examines the impact of NED and PFDM on the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), demonstrating that PFDM shifts the ISCO radius and that the combined effects of NED and PFDM field parameters sufficiently influence orbital stability. Our analysis of the black hole shadow reveals that PFDM increases the shadow radius, while a higher charge reduces it, leading to modifications in potential astrophysical observables. The thermodynamic behavior of the black hole exhibits phase transitions marked by changes in heat capacity, indicating possible stability regimes. Moreover, we derive equations for black hole shadow size and study the spacetime effects on the shadow. These results provide a framework for testing alternative gravity theories and understanding the role of exotic matter in strong gravitational fields. Finally, we compare the constraints on NED and PFDM field parameters derived from our black hole model with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87* and Sgr A*, providing observational limits on deviations from GR."

In this thesis, I demonstrate how perturbative-QCD calculations at asymptotically high baryon densities provide robust constraints on the EoS at neutron-star densities. The method for constraint propagation is based solely on thermodynamical causality, stability, and consistency of the EoS. By constructing a large ensemble of EoSs using Gaussian processes regression and incorporating it into a Bayesian inference of EoS, I demonstrate that the novel pQCD constraints go beyond those obtained from current astrophysical observations alone, forcing the EoS to soften at the maximum densities of stable neutron stars. This softening of the EoS can be interpreted as an indication of approximate conformal symmetry restoration, a sign of a first-order phase transition (FOPT), or potentially both. I show that the conformal symmetry restoration is consistent with the hypothesis of quark matter cores inside the most massive NSs. Although current astrophysical data and theoretical inputs cannot definitively distinguish between the two scenarios, they slightly favor the occurrence of a phase transition of some kind - whether a crossover to quark matter or a destabilizing FOPT - in the cores of the most massive neutron stars."

We focus on the case of a single non-relativistic quantum particle linearly coupled to a thermal bath of noninteracting harmonic oscillators at temperature $T$, a la Caldeira and Leggett. Taking advantage of decoherence in the position representation, we expand the reduced density matrix in powers of the off-diagonal spatial components, so that high-order terms are suppressed at late times. Truncating the resulting power series at second order leads to a set of dissipative transient hydrodynamic equations similar to the non-relativistic limit of equations widely used in simulations of the quark-gluon plasma formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Transport coefficients are directly determined by the damping constant $\\gamma$, which quantifies the influence of the environment. The asymptotic limit of our hydrodynamic equations reduces to the celebrated Navier-Stokes equations for a compressible fluid in the presence of a drag force. Our results shed new light on the onset of hydrodynamic behavior in quantum systems with few degrees of freedom."

And the bond lengths for hydrogenlike molecular ions and molecules are also calculated, whose values are $2.003$ and $1.414$, respectively. Here all the quantities are in atomic unit for convenience.

To this end, we study a two-flavor holographic hard-wall model to investigate the properties of QCD at finite-density and zero temperature with a nonvanishing quark mass. A dense matter phase is described by a classical solution of the equations of motion in a homogeneous Ansatz. We apply holographic renormalization to formulate the holographic dictionary that relates UV boundary data in the bulk with the physical quantities in QCD. We emphasize a role played by an IR boundary action on the hard-wall when analyzing the QCD phase structures in this holographic setup. It is found that a baryonic matter phase is manifested in this model with a high baryon number density and a nearly vanishing chiral condensate. We derive the equation of state for the resulting phase and use it to work out the mass-radius relation for neutron stars. We find that the maximum mass of neutron stars can exceed two solar masses for a wide range of free parameters in this model. We also comment on an alternative scenario about the phase structure such that the baryonic matter phase arises at a baryon number chemical potential greater than a critical value."

      "summary": "arXiv:2506.07018v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The most popular interpretation of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect is that the electromagnetic potential locally affects the complex phase of a charged particle's wave function in the magnetic field free region. However, since the vector potential is a gauge-variant quantity, not a few researchers suspect that it is just a convenient tool for calculating the force field. This motivates them to explain the AB effect without using the vector potential, which inevitably leads to some sort of non-locality. This frustrating situation is shortly summarized by the statement of Aharonov et al. that the AB effect may be due to a local gauge potential or due to non-local gauge-invariant fields. In the present paper, we shall give several convincing arguments, which support the viewpoint that the vector potential is not just a convenient mathematical tool with little physical entity. Despite its gauge arbitrariness, the vector potential certainly contains a gauge-invariant piece, which solely explains the observed AB phase shift. Importantly, this component has a property such that it is basically unique and cannot be eliminated by any regular gauge transformations. To make the discussion complete, we also discuss the role of remaining gauge arbitrariness still contained in the entire vector potential."

An analysis is conducted on how the squeezing effect impacts the three-dimensional HBT radii of $\\phi\\phi$, $D^0$$D^0$, and $K^+$$K^+$. The squeezing effect suppresses the impacts of transverse flow on the transverse source distribution and broadens the space-time rapidity distribution of the particle-emitting source, leading to an increase in the HBT radii, notably in out and longitudinal direction. This phenomenon becomes more significant for higher transverse pair momentum, resulting in a non-monotonic decrease in the HBT radii with increasing transverse pair momentum. The impact of the squeezing effect on the HBT radii is more pronounced for $D^0$$D^0$ than for $\\phi\\phi$. Furthermore, this effect is also more significant for $\\phi$$\\phi$ than for $K^+$$K^+$. The findings presented in this paper could offer fresh perspectives on investigating the squeezing effect."

However, preparation of hadronic wave packets has posed a significant challenge, due to the complexity of hadrons and the precise structure of wave packets. This has limited demonstrations of hadron scattering on quantum simulators to date. Observations of confinement and composite excitations in quantum spin systems have opened up the possibility to explore scattering dynamics in spin models. In this article, we develop two methods to create entangled spin states corresponding to wave packets of composite particles in analog quantum simulators of Ising spin Hamiltonians. One wave-packet preparation method uses the blockade effect enabled by beyond-nearest-neighbor Ising spin interactions. The other method utilizes a quantum-bus-mediated exchange, such as the native spin-phonon coupling in trapped-ion arrays. With a focus on trapped-ion simulators, we numerically benchmark both methods and show that high-fidelity wave packets can be achieved in near-term experiments. We numerically study scattering of wave packets for experimentally realizable parameters in the Ising model and find inelastic-scattering regimes, corresponding to particle production in the scattering event, with prominent and distinct experimental signals. Our proposal, therefore, demonstrates the potential of observing inelastic scattering in near-term quantum simulators."

In this study, we explore how supervised domain adaptation techniques can improve radioisotope identification models by transferring knowledge between different data domains. We begin by pretraining a model for radioisotope identification using data from a synthetic source domain, and then fine-tune it for a new target domain that shares the same label space. Our analysis indicates that fine-tuned models significantly outperform those trained exclusively on source-domain data or solely on target-domain data, particularly in the intermediate data regime ($\\approx 10^2$ to $10^5$ target training samples). This conclusion is consistent across four different machine learning architectures (MLP, CNN, Transformer, and LSTM). Furthermore, our findings show that fine-tuned Transformers yield a statistically significant improvement in test performance compared to the other architectures. Overall, this study serves as a proof of concept for applying supervised domain adaptation techniques to gamma spectroscopy in scenarios where experimental data is limited."

Accurate new experiments have shown a 5% neutrino deficit in the detected flux known as the “reactor antineutrino anomaly”, and an excess at 5 to 7 MeV. The authors explore the effect of one particular and so far not fully appreciated input, the ratio of fission yield from an isomeric state to the total yield, known as the isomeric yield ratio (IYR) and which reflects different endpoint energies of the antineutrino spectra. Examining newly evaluated IYRs, the authors find that the values for certain isotopes significantly increase the antineutrino spectrum around and above 7 MeV with a 50% or greater increase at higher energies.

Traditional methods, including polynomial extrapolation and the Trojan Horse Method, often yield screening potentials exceeding adiabatic predictions. Building on the success of an MLP-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the 6Li(p, {\\alpha})3He reaction [1], this work applies the same approach to the 6Li(d, {\\alpha})4He reaction. Experimental astrophysical S-factor data from literature are reanalyzed using the ANN to model the energy-dependent S-factor. The bare S-factor is extracted from data above 70 keV, where screening effects are minimal, and the screening potential is obtained by comparing with the low-energy region. The resulting screening potential is 147.95 eV, demonstrating the robustness of ANN-based methods for evaluating electron screening in low-energy nuclear reactions involving light nuclei."

For such rapid rotations, where the atoms occupy the lowest Landau level (LLL), the obtained algebraic expressions can address the full LLL spectrum in all its complexity, demonstrating that their spatial, spectral, and spin characteristics manifest formation of collectively rotating and vibrating Wigner molecules. The explicitly exhibited analytic wavefunctions (for two and three spinful $^6$Li atoms) reproduce precisely the corresponding numerical FCI results, and they are shown to reach beyond the limited range of applicability of previous Jastrow-type treatments.

While many studies have examined DM effects on NSs, they often rely on specific choices of equations of state (EOS) models, assume isotropy, and lack a Bayesian statistical framework, limiting their predictive power. In this work, we present a Bayesian framework that couples pressure-anisotropic nuclear EOS to a self-interacting fermionic DM component, constrained by NICER and GW170817 data. Our results show that DM mass fractions up to $\\sim10\\%$ remain consistent with current data, which softens the high-density EOS, leading to reduced stellar radii and tidal deformabilities while requiring negligible pressure anisotropy. Bayesian model comparison reveals no statistically significant preference between pure baryonic and DM-admixed NSs, indicating that DM inclusion enhances physical realism without complexity penalties. However, existing data cannot tightly constrain the DM parameters, and our empirical radius definition introduces a systematic bias toward the DM core configurations. To address this, we therefore introduce the DM radius span $\\Delta R_\\chi \\equiv R_{\\chi,\\mathrm{max}} - R_{\\chi,\\mathrm{min}}$ as a unified diagnostic for DM distributions. This parameter simultaneously characterizes core-halo transition features while exhibiting strong linear correlations ($\\Delta R_\\chi < 4\\,\\mathrm{km}$) with both DM and BM parameters, providing a clear avenue for future constraints.

Here, a modern approach is presented, and demonstrated through determination of the charge radii of the two stable chlorine nuclides $^{35}$Cl and $^{37}$Cl. Knowledge of these radii has implications for fundamental studies in nuclear and atomic physics. For this purpose, a state-of-the-art experiment was performed at the $\\pi$E1 beamline in the Paul Scherrer Institute (Switzerland), using a large-scale HPGe detector array in order to extract precise energies of the muonic $^{35}$Cl and $^{37}$Cl $np1s$ transitions. The nuclear charge radius extraction relies on modern calculations for QED effects and nuclear polarization with rigorous uncertainty quantification, including effects that were not accounted for in older studies. Additionally, we established a new method for applying the nuclear shape correction directly from energy density functionals, which are amenable to isotopes for which no high-quality electron scattering experiments are available. The resulting charge radii are $3.3335(23) fm$ for $^{35}$Cl and $3.3445(23) fm$ for $^{37}$Cl, thus improving the uncertainty of the available electron scattering values by a factor of seven. The correlation of several observables was evaluated between the different isotopes in order to produce a more precise value of the differential mean square charge radius $\\delta \\langle r^2 \\rangle^{37, 35}=+0.0771(66) fm^{2}$. In this case, improvement of the uncertainty by more than one order of magnitude was achieved compared to the literature value.

These baryons form a ten-dimensional representation (decuplet) under the $\\text{SU}(3)$ light-flavor symmetry and, in this limit, are considered indistinguishable under strong interactions. Treating the $S$-matrix in the spin-3/2 baryon-baryon scattering as a quantum logic gate in the spin space, we study the consequence of entanglement suppression and compute the entanglement power of the $S$-matrix. When the entanglement power vanishes, the $S$-matrix is either an Identity or a SWAP gate and spin-flavor symmetries and/or non-relativistic conformal invariance emerge, as previously observed in spin-1/2 baryons. In the case of scattering identical particles, the entanglement power never vanishes due to constraints from spin statistics, which we interpret as projection-valued measurements onto symmetric or antisymmetric Hilbert space and define the entanglement power accordingly. When the entanglement power is non-vanishing but sits at a global or local minimum, enhanced symmetries still emerge and the $S$-matrix can be interpreted as an Identity or a SWAP gate acting on the restricted Hilbert space allowed by quantum statistics. In general, when scattering identical spin-$s$ particles, we identify an enhanced $\\text{SU}(2s+1)_{\\text{spin}}$ symmetry for the Identity gate."

A recent study measured the central object in the HESS J1731-347 supernova remnant (SNR), estimating its mass at $M=0.77^{+0.20}_ {-0.17} \\ M_\\odot$ and radius at $R = 10.40^{+0.86}_{-0.78} \\ \\mathrm{km}$, identifying it as the lightest neutron star ever observed. Conventional models suggest neutron stars form with a minimum gravitational mass of approximately $1.17 \\ M_\\odot$, raising the question of whether this object is a typical neutron star or possibly an \"exotic\" star. To investigate, we utilize the Color-Flavor Locked (CFL) equation of state (EoS), integrating data from the HESS J1731-347 measurement with pulsar observations and gravitational wave detections. Additionally, we construct hybrid EoS by combining the MDI-APR1 (hadronic) and CFL (quark) EoS, introducing a phase transition through Maxwell construction. Our findings reveal that absolutely stable CFL quark matter effectively explains all observed measurements, including the central object of HESS J1731-347, whereas hybrid models incorporating the CFL MIT Bag model cannot account for the masses of the most massive observed pulsars."

This paper develops a charged-current quasielastic (CCQE) neutrino-nucleus scattering model to explore the nuclear mean-field dynamics and short-range correlation effects. In this model, the nuclear structure effect is depicted using the scaling function, while the neutrinonucleon interaction is represented by the elementary weak cross section. Results indicate that the double-differential cross section of scattered muon is influenced by the energy and momentum of nucleon in nuclei, and the total cross section depends primarily on the incident neutrino energy. Furthermore, incorporating short-range correlations yields the flux-integrated differential cross sections at high-T region producing larger values, a longer tail, and achieving better experimental consistency. It eventually elucidates the physical relationship between the neutrinonucleus scattering cross section and the variation in incident neutrino energy. The studies in this paper furnishes insights for the research of nucleon dynamics and provides detailed examinations of the neutrino-nucleus scattering mechanism."

In the inner core of massive neutron stars, it is expected that cold quark matter appears at sufficiently high densities and hence exhibits color superconductivity, surrounded by nucleon superfluids at lower densities. The perturbative expressions of the tunneling current and the friction at the interface are obtained in terms of the non-equilibrium Green's functions.

By solving the Born-Oppenheimer equation for varying $s$-wave scattering lengths between the heavy and light atoms, we demonstrate for both bosonic and fermionic systems that the Efimov spectra and hence the three-body parameters are universal even with the dipole interaction comparable in strength to the van der Waals interaction. While the bosonic systems exhibit Efimov states only in the $M_z=0$ channel, the fermionic systems show a characteristic doublet of the Efimov states in the $M_z=0$ and $M_z = \\pm 1$ channels due to the interplay of finite angular momentum and the anisotropy of the dipole interaction. Both numerical results and analytical formula obtained with the first-order perturbation show that the ratio of the three-body parameters between these two fermionic channels exhibits universality, particularly well in the limit of large mass imbalance. Leveraging this universality, we provide quantitative predictions for the values and ratios of the three-body parameters for experimentally relevant Er-Li and Dy-Li isotopes."

The theoretical abstraction of a collider, namely the study of correlations in asymptotic fluxes, provides one of the most basic examples of an observable in quantum field theory (QFT) and quantum gravity. Energy flux is described in QFT by energy flow operators, a particular example of light-ray operators. In addition to their central role in the theoretical description of collider physics, energy flow operators play an important role in diverse areas of formal QFT and gravity, providing a connection between real world collider phenomenology, and the deep underlying principles of QFT.\n  Recently it has become possible to measure correlation functions of energy flow operators in a wide variety of collider experiments, providing an exciting new connection between collider physics and formal theory. In this review, we provide a survey of recent progress in our understanding of energy operators and their correlators, highlighting their importance in both formal theory and collider phenomenology, and in particular, their great potential for bridging these areas to provide new ways to understand the real world. We intend this article as a resource for both formal theorists interested in understanding how light-ray operators are being applied in particle and nuclear physics, as well as for experimentalists interested in the theoretical motivation for these observables. Most importantly, we aim to stimulate further interaction between the formal, phenomenological and experimental communities through the common lens of energy correlators."

They allow to probe the GFFs of unstable baryons in the baryon octet, since the second moments of hadronic generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) lead to the timelike GFFs. These GDAs can be measured in the process $e^+ e^- \\to B \\bar{B} \\gamma$, in the generalized Bjorken regime where the invariant mass of the $B \\bar{B}$ pair is near threshold at high energy facilities, such as BESIII, Belle II, and the proposed Super Tau-Charm Facility.

We also provide a numerical estimate of the cross sections with a model for baryon-antibaryon GDAs. Our work provides us a possibility to extract the timelike baryon GFFs from near future experimental measurements, and these GFFs may be further used to study longstanding questions in hadronic physics such as the baryon spin decomposition and D-term."

This factorizes the numeric calculation into a ``vector'' that depends only on the astrophysical velocity distribution; a second vector, depending only on the detector form factor; and a scattering matrix defined on the basis functions, which depends on the details of the dark matter (DM) particle model (e.g.~its mass). For common spin-independent DM--Standard Model interactions, this scattering matrix can be evaluated analytically in the wavelet-harmonic basis. This factorization is particularly helpful for the more complicated analyses that have become necessary in recent years, especially those involving anisotropic detector materials or more realistic models of the local DM velocity distribution. With the new method, analyses studying large numbers of detector orientations and DM particle models can be performed more than 10~million times faster.\n  This paper derives several analytic results for the spherical wavelets, including an extrapolation in the space of wavelet coefficients, and a generalization of the vector space method to a much broader class of linear functional integrals. Both results are highly relevant outside the field of DM direct detection."

Within heavy-ion collisions, there are three conserved charges: baryon number (B), strangeness (S), and electric charge (Q). Here we calculate the shear viscosity in two limits using perturbative QCD and an excluded-volume hadron resonance gas at finite BSQ densities. We then develop a framework that interpolates between these two limits such that shear viscosity is possible to calculate across a wide range of finite BSQ densities. We find that the pQCD and hadron resonance gas calculations have different BSQ densities dependence such that a rather non-trivial shear viscosity appears at finite densities."

The analysis is conducted within the framework of $R^2$ gravity, where the gravity model is described by $f(R) = R + a R^2$. Our primary goal is to investigate how variations in the $R^2$ gravity parameter $a$ affect the mass-radius and mass-central density ($M-\\rho_c$) relationships of QSs. Furthermore, we study the dynamical stability of these stars by analyzing the impact of anisotropy parameters $\\beta$ and the interaction parameter $\\lambda$ derived from the EoS, on their stability. Our results demonstrate that the presence of pressure anisotropy plays a significant role in increasing the maximum mass of QSs, with potential implications for the existence of super-massive pulsars.

The absence of a gap in the energy spectrum of quasiparticle excitations leads to a specific heat that is comparable to that in the normal phase in sharp contrast with the exponential suppression in the BCS phase of type $^1S_0$ pairing. Here, we further study gapless superfluidity within the same microscopic framework focusing on hydrodynamic properties. In particular, we calculate the mass fraction transported by the normal fluid of quasiparticle excitations, and we find that it can be finite even at zero temperature. We derive an approximate analytical formula for arbitrary neutron-proton superfluid mixtures. We also present numerical results for neutron stars. Our study suggests that the dynamics of neutron stars may be much more complicated than previously thought. The realization of gapless superfluidity in neutron stars and its implications are discussed."

Using two sets of HO solutions shifted along the z-axis (2-center basis) allows to accurately describe highly elongated nuclear systems while keeping a moderate basis size, making this type of basis very convenient for the description of the nuclear fission process. For the description of odd-even and odd-odd systems, the equal-filling-approximation is used. Several observables can be calculated by the program, including the mean values of the multipole moments, nuclear radii, inertia tensors following Adiabatic Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (ATDHFB) or Generator Coordinate Method (GCM) prescriptions, local and non-local one-body densities, local and non-local pairing densities, some fission fragment properties, etc. The program can ensure that the mean values associated with some specific operators take pre-defined values (constraints). Such constraints can be set on the usual multipole moments (for protons, neutrons or total mass). This program can be used as a monoprocess and monothreaded CLI executable, or through full-featured Python bindings (available through the Python Package Index PyPI)."

Most quantities of interest pertain to the primary fission fragments, whose subsequent decay is typically modeled using statistical reaction models. Consequently, a key objective of fission theory is to inform these models by predicting the initial conditions of the primary fragments. In this work, we employ a framework that combines joint angular momentum and particle number projection with time-dependent configuration mixing to calculate the angular momentum distributions of primary fragments. Focusing on the benchmark cases of neutron-induced fission of $^{235}$U and $^{239}$Pu, we predict - for the first time - microscopic angular momentum distributions for all fragments observed in experiments. Our results reveal a pronounced sawtooth pattern in the average angular momentum as a function of fragment mass, consistent with recent measurements. Additionally, we observe substantial variations in angular momentum distributions along isobaric chains, indicating that commonly used empirical formulas lack sufficient accuracy. We also quantify a strong correlation between the angular momentum and the deformation of the fragments at scission, and a weak correlation in the magnitude of the angular momentum between fragment partners. The generated data will enable estimation of the impact of microscopic distributions on fission spectra, paving the way toward fission modeling based on microscopic inputs."

Specifically, we demonstrate the sensitivity of jet charge distribution to the neutron skin thickness in $e$+Pb collisions with varying centralities, and in isobar collisions of $e$+Ru and $e$+Zr. We predict a strong suppression of positive jet charge distribution and an enhancement for negative jet charge distribution in peripheral electron-ion collisions, revealing the neutron skin effect. This proposal can also be extended to photon and Z-boson tagged jet charge distribution in proton-nucleus collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, providing an alternative access to neutron skin thickness."

Here, $T$ derived from the heavy quarkonium $p_T$ spectra also represents the initial temperature of the collision system, as transverse flow has not yet formed when heavy quarkonia are produced. The related parameters ($\\kappa$ and $T$) are obtained by fitting the experimental $p_T$ spectra of $J/\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon(nS)$ ($n=1$, 2, and 3) within various rapidity intervals, produced in p+p collisions at center-of-mass energies of $\\sqrt{s}=13$ and 8 TeV, as measured by the LHCb Collaboration.

Our results might be of interest for several astrophysical and cosmological problems, but the main physical application we have in mind is the hot deconfined matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Accordingly, as charged particles of the medium we take three species (flavors) of light (massless for the sake of simplicity) quarks -- $u$, $d$ and $s$ -- and antiquarks, entailing the existence of three macroscopic conserved charges: baryon number ${\\cal B}$, electric charge $Q$ and strangeness $S$. Our results are valid both in a weakly and in a strongly-magnetized plasma, where the energy stored in the magnetic field is comparable to the one carried by the medium particles. Actually, for a conformal fluid, the behavior of the system only depends on the ratio between the thermal and the magnetic pressure, the so-called plasma beta-parameter, acting as a scaling variable. Our calculation, starting from a relativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation, is based on a generalized Chapman-Enskog approach in which space-time gradients and the local electric field are treated as first-order quantities in a perturbative expansion, while terms containing magnetic corrections are considered of zeroth order and hence self-consistently resummed. We find that, also in the strong-field limit, for each conserved charge a generalized Wiedemann-Franz law, connecting charge conductivity and diffusion coefficient, exists. However these transport coefficients acquire a non-trivial tensor structure, reflecting the development of a longitudinal, a transverse and a Hall current as a response to electric fields or density gradients."

As an entry point to these challenges, we address the simulation of SU(2) lattice gauge theory. Using qudit registers to encode the digitized gauge field, we provide quantum resource estimates, in terms of elementary qudit gates, for arbitrarily high local gauge field truncations. We then demonstrate an end-to-end simulation of real-time, qutrit-digitized SU(2) dynamics on a cube. Through optimizing the simulation, we improved circuit decompositions for uniformly-controlled qudit rotations, an algorithmic primitive for general applications of quantum computing. The decompositions also apply to mixed-dimensional qudit systems, which we found advantageous for compiling lattice gauge theory simulations. Furthermore, we parallelize the evolution of opposite faces in anticipation of similar opportunities arising in three-dimensional lattice volumes. This work details an ambitious executable for future qudit hardware and attests to the value of codesign strategies between lattice gauge theory simulation and quantum compilation."

This work reports a study of anisotropic expansion of cold $^{6}$Li Fermi gases, initially trapped in an anisotropic potential, as a function of the interaction strength that can be readily tuned by an external magnetic field. It is found that the expansion anisotropy builds up quickly at small interaction strength, without the need of a large amount of interactions. An unexpected and quantitative universal scaling of the expansion anisotropy is observed for the first time between cold atom and heavy-ion systems as a function of the number of collisions per particle or opacity ($n_{\\rm coll}$), despite their vast differences in scale and physics. The expansion isotropy in both the cold atom gases and heavy-ion collisions increases smoothly and shows no sign of saturation in the observed opacity range, with an approximate power-law dependence of $\\sqrt{n_{\\rm coll}}$, characteristic of random walks. This universality potentially unifies a variety of vastly different physical systems, from weakly interacting dilute gases to the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma of the early universe."

      "summary": "arXiv:2406.05025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The trace anomaly $\\Delta\\equiv 1/3-P/\\varepsilon=1/3-\\phi$ quantifies the possibly broken conformal symmetry in supradense matter under pressure $P$ at energy density $\\varepsilon$. Perturbative QCD (pQCD) predicts a vanishing $\\Delta$ at extremely high energy or baryon densities when the conformal symmetry is realized but its behavior at intermediate densities reachable in neutron stars (NSs) are still very uncertain. The extraction of $\\Delta$ from NS observations strongly depends on the employed model for nuclear Equation of State (EOS). Using the IPAD-TOV method based on an Intrinsic and Perturbatively Analysis of the Dimensionless (IPAD) Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations that are further verified numerically by using $10^5$ EOSs generated randomly with a meta-model in a very broad EOS parameter space constrained by terrestrial nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations, here we first show that the compactness $\\xi\\equiv GM_{\\rm{NS}}/Rc^2\\equiv M_{\\rm{NS}}/R$ of a NS with mass $M_{\\rm{NS}}$ and radius $R$ scales very accurately with $\\overline{\\Pi}_{\\rm{c}}\\equiv\\Pi_{\\rm{c}}\\cdot(1+18\\x/25)\\equiv\\x/(1+3\\x^2+4\\x)\\cdot(1+18\\rm{X}/25)$ where $\\x\\equiv\\phi_{\\rm{c}}= P_{\\rm{c}}/\\varepsilon_{\\rm{c}}$ is the ratio of pressure over energy density at NS centers. The scaling of NS compactness thus enables one to readily read off the central trace anomaly $\\Delta_{\\rm{c}}=1/3-\\x$ directly from the observational data of either the mass-radius or red-shift measurements. We then demonstrate indeed that the available NS data themselves from recent X-ray and gravitational wave observations can determine model-insensitively the trace anomaly as a function of energy density in NS cores, providing a stringent test of existing NS models and a clear guidance in a new direction for further understanding the nature and EOS of supradense matter."

      "summary": "arXiv:2411.09139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The search for the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) critical end point (CEP) is a central objective in heavy-ion physics, offering key insights into the phase structure of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions. In this study, finite-size scaling (FSS) analysis is applied to cumulant ratios -- \\( C_2/C_1 \\), \\( C_3/C_2 \\), \\( C_4/C_2 \\), \\( C_3/C_1 \\), and \\( C_4/C_1 \\) -- measured in Au+Au collisions across the Beam Energy Scan (BES-I) range of \\( \\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7\\text{--}200\\,\\text{GeV} \\). The observed scaling behavior reflects the influence of finite-size and finite-time effects, which suppress raw non-monotonic signals and render background-subtraction-based approaches to critical point identification severely unreliable. The scaling functions yield a CEP location at \\( \\sqrt{s}_{\\text{CEP}} \\approx 33.0\\,\\text{GeV} \\), corresponding to \\( \\mu_{B,\\text{CEP}} \\approx 130\\,\\text{MeV} \\) and \\( T_{\\text{CEP}} \\approx 158.5\\,\\text{MeV} \\) based on empirical freeze-out parametrizations. Distinct divergence patterns -- upward for \\( C_2/C_1 \\) and \\( C_4/C_1 \\), and downward for \\( C_3/C_1 \\), \\( C_3/C_2 \\), and \\( C_4/C_2 \\) -- align with predictions from the 3D Ising universality class. These results demonstrate the sensitivity of cumulant ratios as robust, model-independent probes of critical behavior and support the identification of the CEP's location and universality class."

Our purpose is to establish the analytical structure of such states, as well as the prospects (and dangers) of extrapolating results obtained under imaginary rotation to the case of real rotation. We show that in the thermodynamic limit, the state of the system is akin to a stationary system with modified inverse temperature $\\beta_q = q\\beta$ and the same chemical potential, where $q$ is the denominator of the irreducible fraction $\\nu = \\beta \\Omega_I / 2\\pi = p/q$. The temperature of the system becomes a fractal function of the rotation parameter, as in the case of the scalar field. The chemical potential breaks the fractalization of fermions. We also compute the thermodynamic potential $\\Phi$ and associated thermodynamic functions, showing that they also exhibit fractal behavior. Finally, we evaluate the axial and helical fluxes through the transverse plane, generated through the vortical effects, and show that they diverge in the thermodynamic limit, in the case when $\\nu = 1/q$ and $q \\to \\infty$."
