While previous investigations employing PFM and related approaches have primarily focused on the reproduction of scattering phase shifts or cross sections, the present study advances the method to directly reconstruct physically meaningful radial scattering wavefunctions for the $\\ell = 0$, 2, and 4 partial waves without solving the Schr\\\"odinger equation. The computed wavefunctions exhibit well-behaved near-origin and asymptotic characteristics and show excellent agreement with the established resonating-group method results of Hiura \\textit{et al.}. This agreement confirms the numerical robustness and accuracy of the proposed framework. The present results establish PFM as an efficient, unified, and computationally attractive tool for scattering wavefunction reconstruction in cluster--cluster systems, opening new possibilities for its application to more complex nuclear scattering problems."

In this paper, we present a definition of the RSF that is consistent with Hauser-Feshbach reaction codes and that can be efficiently computed with the shell model using the Lanczos strength-function (LSF) method. We introduce a variant of the shell model LSF method that exploits the energy-localized Brink-Axel hypothesis, which makes it possible to compute both electric and magnetic RSFs across all energies relevant to capture reactions. We verify agreement with the conventional definition of RSFs with benchmark calculations of $^{24}$Mg, then present novel results for $^{56}$Fe. For $^{56}$Fe we find that: (i) the M1 RSF shape evolves smoothly with excitation energy, consistent with the energy-localized Brinkl-Axel hypothesis, (ii) both M1 and E1 transitions contribute significantly to the radiative strength below the photo-absorption threshold, and (iii) within the sdpf model space, the strength below 3 MeV observed in Oslo-type experiments cannot be fully reproduced. These results pave the way for a coherent microscopic description of the RSFs and further motivate the use of energy-dependent RSFs in modern reaction codes."

We simulate the longitudinal hydrodynamic evolution with the three diffusion currents in a hydrodynamic model with a lattice-QCD-based equation of state, NEOS-4D, and estimate rapidity distributions including diffusive corrections to the phase-space distribution in the presence of multiple charges, which ensure charge conservation at particlization. We determine the response of particle yields at midrapidity to changes in the diagonal and off-diagonal conductivities.

In standard BBN, most primordial 7Li is produced as 7Be in the early Universe and later converted by electron capture. Additional production or destruction channels of 7Be, such as proton capture or antineutrino capture during BBN, may therefore affect the final lithium yield. We quantify the depletion of 7Be due to in-situ electron capture, including the associated antineutrino channel, positron decay from nuclear excited states, and proton capture through the radiative 7Be(p,gamma)8B reaction. We also investigate stimulated emission induced by the dense photon background during the nuclear statistical equilibrium epoch, as well as a three-body Auger-like variant transferring the capture energy to a continuum electron. Decay rates are computed using first-order perturbation theory, modelling weak interactions with a Fermi contact term and factorising hadronic and leptonic currents. Thermally averaged rates are obtained by folding cross-sections with Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions and accounting for particle densities in the temperature range 10-100 keV. We find that the electron-capture rate decreases rapidly with temperature and is significantly enhanced by the inclusion of the antineutrino channel. Stimulated emission and plasma screening increase the radiative proton-capture rate by only 1-3 percent at temperatures around 87 keV. The Auger-like channel contributes at the level of a few thousandths of a percent and becomes negligible at lower temperatures. Overall, our total rate revises previous estimates by nearly an order of magnitude. Electron capture, proton capture, and positron decay provide corrections to the dominant depletion channel 7Be(n,p)7Li."

In this work, we present a precision benchmark for the two-boson bound-state problem, solving it using two complementary formulations: the standard one-dimensional partial-wave Lippmann--Schwinger equation and a two-dimensional formulation based directly on vector variables. While the partial-wave approach is computationally efficient for low-energy bound states, the vector-variable formulation becomes essential for scattering applications at higher energies where the partial-wave expansion converges slowly. We demonstrate the high-precision numerical equivalence of both methods using rank-one separable Yamaguchi potentials and non-separable Malfliet--Tjon interactions. Furthermore, for the Yamaguchi potential, we derive exact analytical expressions quantifying the systematic errors introduced by finite momentum- and coordinate-space cut-offs. These analytical bounds provide a rigorous tool for disentangling discretization errors from truncation effects in few-body codes. The results establish a reliable reference standard for validating the vector-variable approaches essential for future three- and four-body calculations."

While $\\Delta(\\varepsilon)$ has recently been inferred from neutron star observations, we report the first Bayesian extraction of the trace anomaly from collective flow observables in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions. By employing transport-model simulations that explicitly decouple the cold-matter mean-field potential from thermal effects, we directly constrain the cold dense-matter equation of state (EOS). Remarkably, the trace anomaly inferred from laboratory flow data agrees quantitatively, within $68\\%$ credible intervals, with independent astrophysical posterior bands. This nontrivial agreement demonstrates that heavy-ion collisions and neutron star observations probe the same universal macroscopic properties of dense matter, establishing the trace anomaly as a composition-insensitive descriptor of dense matter across widely different physical environments."

Particularly magnetars, which possess extremely strong magnetic-fields, have attracted increasing attention in connection with nuclear spin dynamics and unconventional pairing correlations. This work is dedicated to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework to describe the structures and properties of two-dimensional (rod-phase) matter in the neutron star inner crust, incorporating band-structure effects, neutron spin-triplet pairing, and strong magnetic-fields on an equal footing. The main results of this study can be summarized as follows. In the first place, the magnetic-fields of the order of $10^{16}\\,$G are found to substantially enhance the neutron effective mass by a factor of approximately $1.5$, indicating a significant modification of entrainment properties in strongly magnetized crustal matter. In the second place, while the overall behavior of pairing phase transitions is qualitatively similar to that observed in one-dimensional systems studied previously, the present two-dimensional calculations reveal a nontrivial role of the spin-orbit interaction in inducing spin-polarization under magnetic fields. In the third place, concerning spin-triplet superfluidity, the rank-0 component is shown to emerge as a consequence of magnetic-field-induced spin-polarization, irrespective of the presence of spin-triplet pairing interactions, whereas the rank-2 component appears only when the corresponding interaction channel is included."

Pairing correlations are incorporated via the time-dependent BCS approximation, which is shown to significantly enhance pair transfer, as evidenced by an increased two-neutron transfer probability. The oblate deformation of $^{96}$Zr causes the transfer probabilities to vary by orders of magnitude with orientation; a direct comparison with experiment is enabled by averaging results over thirteen systematically chosen orientations. While the orientation-averaged one-neutron transfer probabilities agree well with data, the two-neutron channel is suppressed below the Coulomb barrier. This suppression is attributed to missing quantum fluctuations in the semiclassical TD-CDFT approach. To test this, we employ the generalized time-dependent generator coordinate method (TDGCM), which confirms that quantum fluctuations are essential for an accurate description of sub-barrier two-neutron transfer dynamics."

We demonstrate that the quartet BCS theory with the multiple-infinite-product ansatz successfully reproduces an exact four-body result in a one-dimensional four-component Fermi gas at the dilute limit, in contrast to the single-infinite-product ansatz. To see the validity of the quartet BCS state, we derive the self-consistent equation for the quartet superfluid order parameter within the generalized imaginary-time Nambu-Gor'kov formalism, which is found to be consistent with the quartet BCS variational equation. Moreover, by numerically computing the momentum-resolved single-particle spectral function in a one-dimensional system, we discuss how the single-particle spectra evolve with increasing the strength of the four-body cluster formation. We show that a coherent BCS-like quasiparticle branch on the weak-coupling side evolves into a strongly damped, continuum-dominated spectrum in the strong-coupling side, while nonzero quartet superfluid order parameter persists throughout the crossover regime. Our results would be useful for understanding beyond-BCS pairing effects and four-body cluster formations in fermionic systems in an interdisciplinary way."

We follow the the approach of Z. X. Shen et al., arXiv:2510.24325v1 [nucl-th], where Bell states were identified in unpolarized proton-proton elastic scattering. We confirm these results and show that, in the unpolarized proton-deuteron breakup reaction, it is also possible to generate proton-proton entangled Bell states in kinematically complete proton-proton quasi-free scattering (QFS) and final-state interaction (FSI) configurations. We also discuss an experimental setup that, by exploiting such entangled states, could enable the teleportation of quantum mechanical states in a three-proton system. Such an experiment requires triple coincidences among the outgoing nucleons, which precludes the use of entangled Bell states generated with extremely polarized incoming particles. Since counting rates for unpolarized reactions are much higher than for polarized ones, the present results open a pathway toward searching for signatures of quantum state teleportation in hadronic systems."

These constraints are implemented in three complementary ways: (i) through theoretical bounds on the EoS, (ii) implicitly via nuclear matter parameters, and (iii) explicitly by enforcing consistency with experimental binding energies and charge radii of selected nuclei. The resulting low-density nucleonic EoSs are subsequently matched to a model-agnostic speed-of-sound parametrization, constrained by astrophysical observations, including NICER mass-radius measurements, tidal deformability limits from GW170817, and lower bounds on the maximum neutron-star mass inferred from radio pulsar observations. We find that the admissible range of the transition density is strongly sensitive to the choice of the low-density EoS. In particular, the inclusion of explicit FN constraints significantly reduces the allowed parameter space of the nucleonic EoS at low densities, narrowing the transition-density range by nearly a factor of two. Consequently, neutron-star properties inferred from EoSs with explicit FN constraints differ substantially, with especially pronounced effects for low-mass neutron stars and their correlations with nuclear matter parameters. A quantitative comparison, using metrics based on Mahalanobis distance, shows consistency of the explicit constraints with PSRs J0740+6620, J0030+0451, and J0437-4715, but suggest a possible tension with PSR J0614-3329.

Recent findings from the SNO+ and JUNO experiments reveal that cascade decays of $^{214}$Bi-$^{214}$Po in liquid scintillator detectors can mimic inverse beta decay signals from reactor and geoneutrinos, with a misidentification probability on the order of $10^{-4}$ when hydrogen neutron capture is used, a rate ten times higher than Geant4 simulations predicted. This work identifies the $^5$Li resonance in $\\alpha$-$p$ elastic scattering as the underlying cause. For alpha energies above 5~MeV, the cross section is hundreds of times larger than that of Rutherford scattering. After correctly incorporating the differential cross section into Geant4, the misidentification probability is recalculated as 1.9$\\times$10$^{-4}$. The simulated shape of the long tail in the alpha deposited energy also differs from the extrapolation models currently used by SNO+ and JUNO. These results will assist both experiments in more accurately estimating this novel background, thereby refining measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters and the geoneutrino flux.

Although $\\Nc =3$ does not look a large number, the $1/\\Nc$ expansion provides us with a very useful classification and book-keeping scheme for hadronic processes and sharpens conceptions otherwise obscured in real-world QCD with $\\Nc = 3$. Important applications are dense QCD matter where the first principle methods for QCD are not available and many conceptual issues remain to be clarified. In this chapter we first review hadrons at large $\\Nc$ from the viewpoint of quark-gluon dynamics, and then extend the discussions to hot/dense matter, focusing on confinement-deconfinement aspects. We emphasize how the large-$\\Nc$ limit provides a unified organizing principle for hadronic and quark degrees of freedom in regimes where first-principle methods are limited. Two-color and isospin QCD, for which lattice simulations at finite density can be performed for a special reason, is reviewed."

Two resonance states with strangeness $S=-1$ are obtained in the baryon-baryon scattering process. The first candidate is $\\Sigma\\Sigma_b$ in the $\\Lambda\\Lambda_b$ and $N\\Xi_b^*$ scattering process, with the resonance energy 6974.22 MeV - 6975.37 MeV and the decay width 14.450 MeV, respectively; the other one is $\\Sigma \\Sigma_b^*$ in the $N\\Xi_b$ and $N\\Xi'_b$ scattering process, with the resonance energy 6990.69 MeV - 7008.37 MeV and the decay width 43.790 MeV, respectively. The Root Mean Square (RMS) radius calculation shows that the former tends to be in a compact structure, while the latter tends to be in a molecular structure. Both of these resonance states are worthy of experimental exploration. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that the effect of channel-coupling is of great importance in exploring exotic hadron states, and investigating the scattering process may serve as an effective approach to identifying genuine resonances."

The results are compared to predictions of a data-driven artificial neural network application and to configuration-interaction shell-model calculations covering the excitation energy region of the isovector giant dipole resonance. Double-differential cross sections of the $(p,p^\\prime)$ reaction at 295 MeV have been measured between $0^\\circ$ and $14^\\circ$. The angular distributions of the $E1$ parts due to Coulomb excitation have been extracted with a multipole decomposition analysis for excitation energies 12 to 24 MeV and converted to equivalent photoabsorption cross sections with the virtual photon method. Reasonable agreement of the photoabsorption cross sections with previous experiments is found for $^{24}$Mg and $^{28}$Si, while the present results diverge for $^{32}$S. For the first time, data are presented for $^{20}$Ne, $^{26}$Mg and $^{36}$Ar. Configuration-interaction shell-model calculations provide an overall satisfactory description of the fragmented $E1$ strength distributions. The same holds for absolute cross sections except for $^{26}$Mg and $^{36}$Ar, where the experimental results significantly exceed the expected exhaustion of the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn energy-weighted sum rule. Fot light nuclei, there is a larger model dependence compared to previous analyses in heavy nuclei, in particular for excitation energies above 20 MeV, due to the need to constrain the continuum background with additional assumptions. The overall success of the shell-model approach to describe the features of the experimental photoabsorption cross sections motivates its application in large-scale reaction network calculations aiming at an understanding of the mass composition of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays."

These ingredients enable a direct and simultaneous verification, in a common renormalization scheme and scale, of multiple energy-density-based and trace-based mass decomposition sum rules proposed in the literature. We demonstrate the framework for the $\\eta_c$ and $J/\\psi$ charmonia using three fine lattice spacings with a physical strange-quark and near-physical up- and down-quark masses. We present the first lattice-QCD results for the gravitational form factor $\\bar{C}$.

In this PhD Thesis we have investigated the initial stages of proton-ion collisions: in particular, we will focus on the first $\\sim 0.4$ fm/c ($\\sim 10^{-24}$ s) after the collision, which are dominated by very intense gluon fields, in a state called glasma. We investigated the effect of such fields on the dynamics of heavy quarks (charm and beauty) which are created and evolve in this medium. The effect of the initial gluon fields on heavy quarks is quite substantial, in particular we observe that the glasma provokes a $50\\%$ dissociation rate on quark-antiquark pairs. Moreover, glasma fields have a large momentum anisotropy, and transmit a large part of such anisotropy to the heavy quarks which evolve in this medium. Finally, we have generalized our study to a non-boost invariant medium, and shown that fluctuations in rapidity do not lead to significant isotropization within glasma timescales."

      "summary": "arXiv:2601.13310v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The theoretical interpretation of jet observables in heavy-ion collisions is a complex task due to the intricate interplay of perturbative and non-perturbative effects. One way to reduce this complexity is to groom away soft, wide-angle radiation so that perturbative dynamics dominates. Even in this simplified scenario, there are competing explanations for the physical origin of the measured medium-induced modifications. In this paper, we present a minimal approach to compute groomed substructure observables. The core idea is to treat medium effects as an effective energy shift of the hard, vacuum-like substructure. This energy shift includes a gradual onset of colour decoherence effects and thus depends on the jet substructure itself. We first study a NLO-exact dijet configuration in vacuum and apply radiative energy-loss to the two subjets. We find that this minimal setup already captures the narrowing trend of groomed observables but it's not able to quantitatively describe the existing data. Next, we match the NLO matrix-element to a leading-logarithm accurate parton shower and perform a clustering algorithm to recover a two-prong system to which we again apply the energy-loss distribution. Despite its simplicity, the model results in a very good theory-to-data agreement (within $10\\%$) for a broad range of observables including both ALICE and ATLAS kinematics. We also examine the discriminating power of groomed jet data in terms of colour decoherence effects and find that substructure-dependent energy loss yields an overall better agreement."

In this work, we introduce a framework for addressing this question in data-driven hadronic physics problems by developing diagnostic tools - centered on a quantitative quantum qualifier - that guide model selection between classical and quantum deep neural networks based on intrinsic properties of the data. Using controlled classification and regression studies, we show how relative model performance follows systematic trends in complexity, noise, and dimensionality, and how these trends can be distilled into a predictive criterion. We then demonstrate the utility of this approach through an application to Compton form factor extraction from deeply virtual Compton scattering, where the quantum qualifier identifies kinematic regimes favorable to quantum models. Together, these results establish a principled framework for deploying quantum machine-learning tools in precision hadronic physics."

Our results demonstrate that the non-perturbatively calculated longitudinal momentum distributions exhibit significant deviations from leading-order perturbative predictions, emphasizing the importance of higher-order Fock components in describing the proton's sea quark structure. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of extending this framework to investigate nuclear effects in light nuclei, such as the deuteron.

Using a quasi-static equilibrium approach, we follow the Kelvin--Helmholtz evolution from hot, lepton-rich matter to a cold, catalyzed quark star. Rotation substantially enhances the maximum stable mass (by up to $\\sim 40\\%$), equatorial radius, and key rotational observables, with the ratio of rotational kinetic to gravitational potential energy, $T_{\\rm kin}/|W|$, reaching $0.18$--$0.19$ near the Keplerian limit, indicating a heightened susceptibility to gravitational-wave--emitting instabilities. Thermal evolution introduces a clear ordering: all stellar properties peak during the lepton-rich stages and decrease monotonically as the star cools. Compared to hadronic stars, rotating protoquark stars exhibit larger radii, higher moments of inertia, and stronger quadrupolar deformation, producing a distinct signature in the mass--radius--spin plane that can accommodate objects such as HESS~J1731--347 and PSR~J0740+6620. These results demonstrate that future multimessenger observations must account for both thermal history and rotation to robustly identify quark matter in compact stars."

A critical parameter in this investigation is the bag parameter $B$, which quantifies the QCD vacuum energy and can be computed using nonperturbative methods such as Lattice QCD (LQCD). By combining the equation of state derived from perturbative QCD (pQCD) with the bag parameter to fit the LQCD-simulated data for isospin-dense matter, we address the stability of quark matter within the LQCD+pQCD framework. Our findings suggest that the current data imposes an upper bound on $B^{1/4} \\lesssim 160$ MeV, approaching a conclusive statement on quark matter stability. Given the lower bound on $B$ from the quark condensate contribution to the vacuum energy, the stable 2-flavor quark matter remains possible, whereas the stable 2+1-flavor quark matter is excluded, assuming complete deconfinement and chiral-symmetry restoration and the reliability of pQCD at baryon chemical potentials around the proton mass. Additionally, we derive more general thermodynamic bounds on the quark matter energy-per-baryon and $B$, which, while weaker, provide complementary insights."
