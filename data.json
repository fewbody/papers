However, these ANNs are typically treated as ``black boxes'', with their architecture (width, depth, and weight/bias initialization) and the training algorithm and parameters chosen empirically by optimizing learning based on limited exploration. We test a non-empirical approach to understanding and optimizing nuclear physics ANNs by adapting a criticality analysis based on renormalization group flows in terms of the hyperparameters for weight/bias initialization, training rates, and the ratio of depth to width. This treatment utilizes the statistical properties of neural network initialization to find a generating functional for network outputs at any layer, allowing for a path integral formulation of the ANN outputs as a Euclidean statistical field theory. We use a prototypical example to test the applicability of this approach: a simple ANN for nuclear binding energies. We find that with training using a stochastic gradient descent optimizer, the predicted criticality behavior is realized, and optimal performance is found with critical tuning. However, the use of an adaptive learning algorithm leads to somewhat superior results without concern for tuning and thus obscures the analysis. Nevertheless, the criticality analysis offers a way to look within the black box of ANNs, which is a first step towards potential improvements in network performance beyond using adaptive optimizers."

In low-energy nuclear physics applications normal-ordered Hamiltonians consisting of two- and three-nucleon forces are usually truncated at the two-body rank with residual three-nucleon operators being discarded. Benchmark computations have showed that this truncation is accurate, but we lack an understanding about why it works. We show that the normal-ordered two-body truncation is exact for zero-range three-body forces when nuclei are computed using the coupled cluster with singles and doubles method. As the nuclear three-nucleon force is short ranged and a three-body contact is a leading term in effective field theories of quantum chromodynamics, our result provides an analytical basis for the popular normal-ordered two-body approximation."

This method is applied to the nucleon-meson effective field theory, also known as the Walecka model, to study the properties of nuclear matter at high baryon densities. It is found that both the attractive and repulsive nucleon meson interactions are screened by the high density medium, which results in a stiffer equation of state (EoS) of nuclear matter in the regime of $\\rho_0 \\lesssim \\rho \\lesssim 2.5 \\rho_0$, then a softer EoS when $\\rho \\gtrsim 2.5 \\rho_0$. Here $\\rho_0$ denotes the saturation baryon density of symmetric nuclear matter. Furthermore, a new phenomenon called the locking of Fermi surface is found. In the locking of Fermi surface the effective energy of quasi-nucleon is always close to the Fermi surface, which are both running with the renormalization group scale."

To mitigate contamination from around-the-world effects, we develop a new method to reconstruct and subtract them directly from lattice data. We then perform a nonperturbative renormalization using the RI/SMOM scheme. Compared with previous studies, this work reduces the uncertainties in the matrix elements and provides an independent cross-check that helps to reconcile the discrepancies among previous lattice calculations."

A promising explanation is the $\\nu p$-process, which is posited to operate in the neutrino-driven outflows that form inside core-collapse supernovae after shock revival. Recent studies have identified several relevant physical effects that influence the yields of this process. The impact of General Relativity (GR) on the $\\nu p$-process yields, however, remains unexplored. In this work, we perform a comparative analysis of the time-integrated yields of the $p$ nuclei up to $A \\lesssim 105$ in Newtonian and fully GR neutrino-driven outflows, using a detailed model of a time-evolving outflow profile. The two main GR effects are the gravitational shift of neutrino energies and post-Newtonian corrections to the gravitational potential. These effects together suppress the production of seed nuclei, significantly boosting the $\\nu p$-process yields in our 18 $M_\\odot$ progenitor model. Most of the production of the crucial $^{92,94}{\\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\\rm Ru}$ $p$ isotopes in this model occurs in an optimal time window, 1-3 seconds after shock revival. Interestingly, the same does not apply to the shielded isotope $^{92}{\\rm Nb}$, a large fraction of which is produced in the subsequent ejecta. The impact of GR on this isotope is especially large, with its final abundance boosted by a factor of 25 compared to a Newtonian calculation. In our 12.75 $M_\\odot$ model, an additional GR effect is observed: the outflow transitions to the supersonic regime several seconds into the explosion, causing the yields to drop. This study quantifies the important role GR effects play in the $\\nu p$-process and provides guidance for identifying optimal conditions in future self-consistent supernova simulations."

In this framework, the nucleon is modeled as a skyrmion, and a scalar meson is introduced to incorporate the effects of the scale anomaly via low-energy theorems. The contributions from the current quark mass and gluonic dynamics to the scale anomaly are encoded through the pion and scalar meson masses, respectively. By decomposing the nucleon's energy-momentum tensor, we isolate the anomalous components and analyze their role in generating pressure. We find that the gluonic contribution to the scale anomaly plays a dominant role in producing confining pressure. In comparison with results from conventional chiral perturbation theory in the chiral limit, the total pressure derived from sChPT provides improved qualitative agreement with lattice QCD results. We also evaluate the D-term and compare it with recent lattice and model-independent determinations."

This provides a strong case for the possible existence of strange quark stars, suggesting that they should be considered among the population of compact stars during analyses of astrophysical data.

The results show that the $\\delta$ and $\\rho$ meson related exchange terms have a nonnegligible contribution to the $\\sigma^{*}_{N \\Delta}$ compared to only considering the $\\rho$ meson exchange terms, although there is a significant cancellation on the cross section among these meson exchange terms. In addition, due to the different effects of the medium correction on the effective mass of neutrons, protons, and differently charged $\\Delta$s, the individual $\\sigma^{*}_{N \\Delta}$ exhibits an ordered isospin-asymmetry ($\\alpha$) dependence, and $\\sigma^{*}_{n\\Delta}$ and $\\sigma^{*}_{p\\Delta}$ have opposite $\\alpha$ dependencies.

Within this model, charmed mesons' masses are computed, comparing theoretical predictions to experimental data. The results, within uncertainties, suggest that our theoretical framework generally reproduces mass splittings and level ordering observed for charmed mesons. Particularly, large discrepancies between theory and experiment found in $P$-wave states are, at least, significantly ameliorated by incorporating higher-order interaction terms. Therefore, the findings emphasize that while the traditional quark model is limited in fully describing charmed mesons, enhanced potential terms may bridge the gap with experimental observations.

The low-energy scattering parameters are then extracted — using a simple analytic formula — from the functional dependence of these energies upon the trap size. We first test the recipe against a simple model problem and then apply it to low-energy nucleon-nucleon scattering within the nuclear Model with Explicit Mesons in one sigma-meson approximation."
