The results indicate that incorporating nonlocal effects significantly impacts half-life calculations, while the BNN method substantially improves prediction accuracy and demonstrates strong extrapolation capabilities. Using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), we conducted a quantitative comparison among the four input feature parameters in the BNN, revealing that the $\\alpha$ decay energy $Q_{\\alpha}$ is the predominant contributor to $T_{1/2}$. Leveraging the BNN robust extrapolation capability, we predicted $\\alpha$ decay half-lives for the isotopic chains (Z=118, 120), revealing a significant shell effect at N=184 of neutrons.\n  Keywords: $\\alpha$ decay, half-lives, nonlocal effects, Bayesian neural network, Coulomb and proximity potential model."

      "summary": "arXiv:2507.19135v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We study the flavor dependence of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) by analyzing two key charge-separation correlators used to characterize the charge separation effect: the conventional $\\Delta\\gamma$ and the recently proposed $R_{\\psi_2}$. Using the AMPT (A Multiphase Transport) model with an initial-state centrality-dependent charge separation, we evaluate the sensitivity of these correlators to 2-flavor ($u,d$) and 3-flavor ($u,d,s$) quark scenarios. While both correlators exhibit modest flavor dependence in mid-central (30-50\\%) collisions, their discriminative power varies significantly with centrality and transverse momentum ($p_T$), limiting their utility disentangling the flavor dependent scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we develop a neural network classifier trained on final-state hadronic observables (e.g., $dN_{ch}/d\\eta$, $p_T$ spectra). The model achieves $>90\\%$ accuracy in flavor classification by leveraging multi-observable correlations, with $p_T$-differential features proving particularly discriminative. Crucially, by incorporating background contributions directly into the training data, our approach provides more reliable flavor estimates than correlator-only methods."

We show that no three-body parameter is required to make predictions in this case and map out the universal features of such systems. We furthermore study the dependence of these universal features on the core mass. We apply our framework to the two-neutron halo nucleus ${}^{22}$C."

The study analyzes two fundamental approaches -- statistical and microscopic. Special attention is given to their implementation within both classical and superfluid models, enabling a more detailed description of nuclear dynamics during fission. Various physical factors influencing the calculation of moments of inertia are examined, including transverse vibrational modes and nucleon exchange mechanisms. These effects significantly impact spin distributions and the interpretation of experimental data. The analysis also addresses the role of nuclear models that vary with fragment deformation, allowing key regularities in internal structure to be identified. Emphasis is placed on comparing theoretical predictions with experimental results, which remain essential for model validation. This approach not only deepens understanding of fission mechanisms but also supports the broader study of fundamental nuclear properties."

Using femtoscopy data from the ALICE and STAR collaborations, we constrain the strength of the interaction, encoded in the tunable short-range parameter introduced in the potential. The resulting model provides a good description of the measured correlation functions and favors the existence of a bound state in the \\({}^5S_2\\) channel with a binding energy of approximately \\(0.5\\,\\mathrm{MeV}\\). The role of the \\({}^3S_1\\) channel, however, remains poorly constrained due to the absence of an accurate model accounting for its inelastic contributions."

The noniterative FAM is used to derive equations of quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA) for neutron-induced inelastic scatterings to both the discrete and continuum states in a consistent manner. The Skyrme force is employed as an interaction between the projectile neutron with nucleons inside the target nucleus. We apply this method to the neutron-induced reaction on 208Pb. We demonstrate that the calculated differential inelastic scattering cross sections to low-lying states reproduce available experimental data without any phenomenological parameters that are often introduced in conventional DWBA calculations. The calculated double differential cross section to the continuum state also agrees with the experimental data in the energy region relevant to the direct and pre-equilibrium processes. These results are used to investigate the spin distribution of the populated states in the residual nucleus."

These correlators can be computed in the color-glass condensate effective field theory by using a Gaussian model for the color density of the target. In this work, we generalize the Gaussian model to a generic function that is local in the transverse coordinates and the light-cone time, and show how to compute physical Wilson-line correlators in this model. We also consider a simple model for the color density based on stable probability distributions and show that the small-dipole behavior of the dipole amplitude is modified from quadratic to a power law, where the power is given by the stability parameter of the distribution. This generalization of the Gaussian model is suitable for numerical applications in the high-energy limit and can be used in future phenomenological studies of the nuclear structure."

Assuming local equilibrium on an iso-energy density hypersurface, we study the $\\Lambda$ hyperon spin polarization, and compute corrections to the isothermal case due to finite density. We argue that corrections to isothermal freezeout should be small, and that even in heavy ion collisions with energy as low as $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 11.5$ GeV they constitute at most a $10\\%$ effect.

This comparison demonstrates that genuine correlations exists for small angle and moderate/large angle, indicating that they are coming from correlated splitting. This method will provide a unique tool to disentangle different physics, by comparing the genuine correlations in jet EEC between heavy ion collisions and proton-proton collisions. It will help to expose the medium modification of parton splitting in hot QCD medium. On the other hand, the medium responses are expected to be canceled out in the genuine correlations."

Models fit to some data sets using chi-squared minimization can predict inaccurate pole positions for the rho(770), while SBI provides more robust predictions across the same models and data. This result is significant both as a proof of concept that SBI can handle model misspecification, and because accurate modeling of pi-pi scattering is essential in the study of many contemporary physical systems (e.g., a1(1260), omega(782))."

By incorporating the effects of spin mixing and quark Landau levels, we employ a nonrelativistic Hamiltonian that captures the essential features of quark dynamics in a magnetic field. The two-body Schr\\\"odinger equation is solved using the cylindrical Gaussian expansion method, which respects the cylindrical symmetry induced by a magnetic field. We extract the corresponding light-front wave function (LFWF) densities and analyze their transverse and longitudinal structures, revealing characteristic features such as transverse momentum broadening. While the longitudinal structure is only slightly modified within the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian, we discuss some corrections that can significantly affect its longitudinal structure. Furthermore, we discuss the structure modifications of excited states and find notable changes in the LFWF densities, and state reshuffling near avoided crossings. These results demonstrate the sensitivity of hadron structure to external magnetic fields and help bridge our understanding to relativistic approaches."
