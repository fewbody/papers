Specifically, we demonstrate that the neutron skin thickness of the lead nucleus can be extracted in $p$+$^{208}$Pb collisions by analyzing a double ratio: The ratio of net electric charge to net baryon number measured near the lead-going rapidity, taken for high-multiplicity events and divided by the same ratio for low-multiplicity events. We compute the expected sensitivity of the double ratio to the neutron skin within a comprehensive (3+1)D relativistic hydrodynamic framework that incorporates multiple conserved charge currents and a charge-dependent lattice-QCD-based equation of state. We provide predictions for both $p$+$^{208}$Pb collisions at ${\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}=72}$~GeV and $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$~TeV, corresponding to the center of mass energies realized in the SMOG2 fixed-target setup at LHCb and the LHC collider mode, respectively."

Using self-consistent finite-temperature Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations with the Skyrme-type energy-density functional SkM$^*$, we derive and compare effective potentials corresponding to different thermodynamic processes -- isothermal ($T=\\text{const}$), isentropic ($S=\\text{const}$), and isoenergetic ($E=\\text{const}$) -- as functions of quadrupole deformation and excitation energy. At the same amount of excitation energy the isoenergetic description predicts the highest fission barrier and the largest damping factor. The suppression of the isoenergetic fission barrier is analyzed by examining how the driving force changes with increasing excitation energy and by studying the contribution of the nonpotential term to the effective potential. Within the framework of the three thermodynamic schemes considered, the different behavior of temperature and entropy along the fission pathway is also emphasized. A transition of the effective level-density parameter from a deformation-sensitive quantity at low excitation energies to a nearly constant value at high energies is observed, in line with the Fermi-gas model expectations."

The remaining theoretical problem related to the description of the off-shell behavior of the elementary amplitudes of the $NN \\to NN$ and $NN \\leftrightarrow N\\Delta$ transitions is discussed.

These interactions can completely disintegrate a nucleus of iron over trajectory lengths of a few and up to hundreds of megaparsecs, depending on the energy of the UHECR. The stochastic nature of these interactions means that it is not possible to describe them deterministically for a single cosmic ray, and an exact formulation of the probability distributions is not yet available. Current approaches describe these interactions using either Monte Carlo simulations or solving ordinary differential equations that neglect stochasticity. Because of the limitations of these approaches, only partial capture of the process is achieved. This paper presents an analytic probabilistic description of UHECR interactions and the resulting nuclear cascades, establishing their connection to Markov jump processes. The fundamental properties of these cascades are presented, as is the computation of the usual quantities of interest, such as the horizon, spectrum, and composition. The benefits of this description are outlined using astrophysical examples related to extragalactic propagation and UHECR sources."

These wavefunctions are then employed to compute the unpolarized generalized parton distributions (GPDs) and the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs) of valence quarks and gluons. We also extract the transverse spatial distributions, providing the squared radii of quark and gluon densities in the impact-parameter space.

The CME-sensitive observable, charge-dependent three-point azimuthal correlator $\\Delta\\gamma$, is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the particle's elliptic flow anisotropy $v_2$. Event-shape engineering (ESE) binning events in dynamical fluctuations of $v_2$ and event-shape selection (ESS) binning events in statistical fluctuations of $v_2$ are two methods to search for the CME by projecting $\\Delta\\gamma$ to the measured anisotropy $v_2=0$ intercept. We conduct a systematic study of these two methods using physics models as well as toy model simulations. It is observed that the ESE method fulfills the general premise of measuring the CME but is statistically hungry. It is found that the intercept from the ESS method depends on the details of the event content, such as the mixtures of background-contributing sources, because of statistical fluctuations of intertwining variables used in the method, and is thus not practically useful or clean to measure the CME."

We analyze its geodesic structure, shadow, and optical appearance. An analysis of the effective potential and epicyclic frequencies reveals that the existence of innermost/outermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs/OSCOs) for timelike particles is controlled by the parameters of the MCDF and the cloud of strings. The behavior of orbital conserved quantities and the Keplerian frequency are also examined. By equating the influence of the MCDF on the spacetime metric at spatial infinity with that of a cosmological constant, we constrain the MCDF parameters using the observed shadow radii of Sgr A* and M87*. We investigate the effects of the cloud of strings and MCDF on the shadows and optical images of the black hole, assuming various thin disk accretion profiles. Using the method developed by Wald and collaborators, light trajectories are classified by their impact parameters into direct emission, the lensing ring, and the photon ring. The presence of OSCOs can lead to the existence of outer edges in the direct emission and lensing ring images. The observed brightness primarily originates from direct emission, with a minor contribution from the lensing ring, whereas the contribution of the photon ring is negligible owing to extreme demagnification. The influence of the cloud of strings and MCDF parameters on all results is analyzed throughout the study."

By taking the static spherically symmetric Schwarzschild star with a photon sphere as an example, we find that its inner photon rings can be more non-circular and thicker than the outer ones and show that the inclusion of the inner photon rings can result in new features in the interferometric pattern. Further, our formulae can be applied to other ultracompact objects, providing a convenient approach for studying the observational properties of their higher-order photon rings."

In this paper, we consider the measurements of the vector boson fusion processes of to a pair of fermions (along with a or pair) at a high-energy muon collider and study their potential for probing EW observables. We consider two run scenarios for the muon collider with center-of-mass energies of 10 and 30 TeV, respectively, and focus on the processes involving and the dimension-6 operators that directly modify the corresponding fermions coupling to the bosons. The invariant mass distribution of the pair helps to separate the events from the and high-energy resonances, whereas the polar angle of the outing fermion provides additional information. Through a chi-squared analysis on the binned distributions and combining the information from the WW and fusion processes, all relevant Wilson coefficients can be constrained simultaneously. The precision surpasses the current EW measurement constraints and is even competitive with future colliders. Our analysis can be included in a more complete framework that is required to fully determine the potential of muon colliders in EW precision measurements."

The major contributing bands in the observed splitting are Kπ=7/2–:5/2[512]ν↑ 3/2[651]ν↑ 1/2[660]ν↓, Kπ=5/2–: 5/2[512]ν↑ 3/2[651]ν↑ 3/2[651]ν↓, Kπ=1/2–:3/2[521]ν↑ 1/2[660]ν↑ 3/2[651]ν↓, Kπ=1/2–: 3/2[521]ν↓ 1/2[660]ν↑ 3/2[651]ν↑, Kπ=5/2–:3/2[521]ν↑ 3/2[651]ν↑ 1/2[660]ν↓, and Kπ=3/2–: 3/2[521]ν↑ 3/2[651]ν↑ 3/2[651]ν↓, which mix through rotor-particle (ΔK=1) and particle-particle (ΔK=0) couplings among the bands comprising the given basis space. The observed signature splitting is also well-reproduced by the superposition of calculated energy staggering of the strongly interacting bands, which further strengthens the validity of present particle rotor model calculations. Based on the present calculations, we assign the bandhead spin Kπ= 3/2– to the band under discussion. Additionally, the locations of 13 low-lying band members in the spin range Iπ=3/2– to 23/2– and at 27/2– and 31/2– are predicted, which will be useful for future experimental investigations."

Rev. D 108, 054011 (2023)]. Our results indicate that the decay width for the coupled molecule with is on the order of several MeV, with the channel being dominant. For the coupled molecule with , the decay widths are on the order of tens of MeV, with the dominant channels being and , respectively. For the molecules with , the decay width can reach one hundred MeV, with and being the dominant decay channels. The decay widths for the molecules with and are on the order of tens of MeV, with the dominant decay modes being and , respectively. The branching ratios for all the discussed channels exhibit slight dependence on the binding energies."

      "summary": "We discuss the landscape of flavor physics at the Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC), based on the nominal luminosity outlined in its Technical Design Report. The CEPC is designed to operate in multiple modes to address a variety of tasks. At the Z pole, the expected production of 4 Tera Z bosons will provide unique and highly precise measurements of Z boson couplings, while the substantial number of boosted heavy-flavored quarks and leptons produced in clean Z decays will facilitate investigations into their flavor physics with unprecedented precision. We investigate the prospects of measuring various physics benchmarks and discuss their implications for particle theories and phenomenological models. Our studies indicate that, with its highlighted advantages and anticipated excellent detector performance, the CEPC can explore beauty and τ physics in ways that are superior to or complementary with the Belle II and Large-Hadron-Collider-beauty experiments, potentially enabling the detection of new physics at energy scales of 10 TeV and above. This potential also extends to the observation of yet-to-be-discovered rare and exotic processes, as well as testing fundamental principles such as lepton flavor universality, lepton and baryon number conservation, etc., making the CEPC a vibrant platform for flavor physics research. The WW threshold scan, Higgs-factory operation and top-pair productions of the CEPC further enhance its merits in this regard, especially for measuring the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements, and Flavor-Changing-Neutral-Current physics of Higgs boson and top quarks. We outline the requirements for detector performance and considerations for future development to achieve the anticipated scientific goals. The role of machine learning for innovative detector design and advanced reconstruction algorithms is also stressed. The CEPC flavor physics program not only develops new capabilities for exploring flavor physics beyond existing projects but also enriches the physics opportunities of this machine. It should be remarked that, given the richness of the CEPC flavor physics, this manuscript is not meant to be a comprehensive survey, but rather an investigation of representative cases. Uncovering the full potential of flavor physics at the CEPC will require further dedicated explorations in the future."
