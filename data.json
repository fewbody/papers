The formulation of the 3-body dynamics is based on the equations of motion method for identical fermions -- also denoted as quantum correlation dynamics -- and presented in detail. The on-shell 2-body collision integral is briefly reviewed and the on-shell 3-body collision integral is derived on the basis of the same two-body interaction in leading order. The resulting equations obey particle number as well as energy-momentum conservation. For a quantification of the relative impact of 3-body interactions we employ a model study for a homogeneous system in space in a finite box with periodic boundary conditions. We address spin-isospin symmetric nuclear matter systems with momentum distributions that are given by shifted Fermi spheres (without overlap) as encountered in the initial phase of nucleus-nucleus collisions after contact. The results for the relaxation times -- employing an effective 2-body interaction -- are compared to Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BUU) transport calculations in the continuum limit for the same bombarding energies and are found to agree on the level of a few percent. We find that the additional 3-body interactions reduce the relaxation times up to a factor of 3 at 130 A$\\cdot$MeV. Furthermore, it is shown in BUU transport calculations that an enhanced stopping by 3$\\leftrightarrow$3 collisions shows up in the angular distribution of energetic nucleons ($>$ 60 MeV) e.g. in central $^{97}_{45}Rh$ collisions at 40 A$\\cdot$MeV that lead to the formation of a compound nucleus. The angular distribution of the energetic nucleons changes from a slightly forward peaked angular distribution to a slightly sidewards peaked angular distribution which might be controlled experimentally."

By confronting with recent neutron star observation constraints, we find it possible to have the early phase transitions (PT) at low densities ($n_B \\leq 2n_0$) in a way consistent with existing neutron star observations. We also establish the upper limits of the PT strength for each chiral invariant mass in parity doublet model. We find that larger chiral invariant mass lead to smaller allowed phase transition strengths, providing new insights and clue into nucleon mass origin. This connection between the microscopic structure of nucleons and macroscopic neutron star properties shows how astrophysical observations can constrain fundamental QCD mechanisms underlying hadron mass generation."

Key elements to be considered are the correct description of the asymptotics, antisymmetrization issues and, in most cases, the treatment of the Coulomb interaction. In the case of the $ppp$ correlation function, a first analysis was done where the hyperspherical adiabatic method was used to determine the $ppp$ wave function at different energies. Although the asymptotic behavior, antisymmetrization issues and the treatment of the Coulomb interaction were discussed in detail, the convergence properties of the adiabatic basis were studied at low energies around the formation of the correlation peak determined mainly by the $J^\\pi=1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$ three-body states. Since many and very precise data have been taken or are planned to be measured at energies beyond the peak, we present an analysis of the convergence characteristics of the basis as the energy of the process increases. We show that in order to describe correctly the correlation tail it is necessary to consider three-body states up to $J^\\pi=21/2^-$ whereas higher states can be considered as free. Once those states are incorporated solving the associate dynamical equations, the agreement with the experimental data is found to be excellent."

      "summary": "arXiv:2505.22412v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Charge radii are sensitive indicators to identify the nuclear structure phenomena throughout the whole nuclide chart. In particular, the shrunken trend of changes of charge radii along a long isotopic chain is intimately associated with the shell quenching effect. In this work, the systematic evolution of charge radii along the proton numbers $Z=8$, $10$, $12$, $14$, $18$ isotopes is investigated by a relativistic Hartree Bogoliubov model. A ansatz about neutron-proton correlation around Fermi surface is considered for describing the abnormal behavior of nuclear charge radii. Our results show that the neutron-proton pairing corrections around the Fermi surface lead to a sudden strengthening of the charge radii of these isotopic chains at $N=8$, 20 and 28, reflecting the fact that this correction enhances the shell closure across $N=8$, 20 and 28. The reproduction of the $N=14$ charge radius in the Mg isotopes is affected by the way in which pairing correlations are handled, with BCS theory overestimating the shell effect of $N=14$, and the Bogoliubov quasiparticle transformation suggests a stronger pairing correlation near the proton Fermi surface, which is more consistent with experimental results. An analysis of the deviations from the theoretical and available experimental data for the charge radii of the 24 selected even-even nuclei shows that the neutron-proton pairing correction around the Fermi surface has an improved effect on the calculation of the charge {radii} using the meson-exchange effective interactions, but it does not help to significantly improve the results calculated by the density-dependent effective interactions."

      "summary": "arXiv:2505.21667v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Post-merger gravitational-wave emission from a binary neutron star merger carries crucial information about the equation of state (EoS) of matter at high temperatures. Current gravitational wave detectors have limited sensitivities at post-merger frequencies in the range [1.5, 4] kHz. Therefore, valuable inferences can only be made after combining information from multiple (BNS) events. Criswell et al. [Phys. Rev. D 107, 043021 (2023)] carries out an injection study to infer the radius posterior for a $1.6 M_{\\odot}$ NS by combining the information from injected BNS events via the hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) formulation. This formulation utilizes empirical relations that connect the peak frequency of the post-merger remnant with the chirp mass of the system, and the EoS proxy parameter $R_{1.6}$. In this work, we extend the HBI formulation to other EoS proxy parameters (i.e., the radius of (NS), $R_{1.X}$, with masses 1.2, 1.4, and 1.8 $M_{\\odot}$) and combine the four $R_{1.X}$ posteriors through the piecewise polytropic EoS model to obtain measurable constraints on the EoS of the NS. We show that the NS radii can be constrained to within $\\sim$1 km ( $\\sim$0.55 km) assuming uniform (astrophysical) prior on $R_{1.X}$ for injections in the A+ noise. We also study systematic biases in the analysis coming from the limitations of empirical relations."

As a first study of this problem in the strongly coupled regime, we investigate holographically the spectral function of a probe baryon in the fluid-gravity background. This is done by carefully performing gradient expansion of the Dirac equation in the fluid-gravity background. Different contributions in the expansion are understood in terms of density matrices of the probe baryon and the medium. The resulting spectral functions indicate that the holographic baryonic is polarized as responses to fluid acceleration, shear stress and vorticity. The structures of the responses are similar to those found in weakly coupled studies."

The study is performed employing a hybrid model encompassing IPGlasma + MUSIC + iSS + UrQMD. The results of the clustered nuclear geometry are compared with those of the Woods-Saxon nuclear profile. Both initial and final state anisotropies are explored. This study is thus one of its first kind, where the study of anisotropic flow coefficients for p-O and O-O collisions is presented using a hybrid hydrodynamics model. We find a small effect of $\\alpha$-clustering in p-O, while a significant one for O-O collisions. It is also observed that the magnitude of the effect correlates with the size of the $^{4}$He."

The renormalized QMD allows analytical investigations of key quantities such as the zero-temperature diquark gap and the critical temperature for color superconductivity, ultimately reproducing the exact BCS relation in the high-density limit. We carry out the same analysis for different schemes of RG-consistent QMD models. We show that the RG-consistent approach yields a phase diagram and thermodynamic properties qualitatively similar to those of the renormalization model, provided both are embedded within a unified scheme that ensures consistent vacuum properties. In particular, both treatments recover the expected high-density features characterized by the BCS relation and the Stefan-Boltzmann limit. Our results highlight the relevance of renormalization and RG-consistent methods for accurately capturing the thermodynamics of QMD and related effective models with diquark degrees of freedom."

Among other sources of spin polarization phenomena, the Debye mass of a medium plays a crucial role in particle polarization. Any modification brought to the effective mass due to the temperature, strong magnetic field ($eB$), baryonic chemical potential ($\\mu_{B}$), medium anisotropy ($\\xi$), and vorticity, etc., certainly affects the particle spin polarization. In this work, we explore the global hyperon spin polarization and the spin alignment of vector mesons corresponding to the strong magnetic field, baryonic chemical potential, and medium anisotropy. We find that the degree of spin polarization is flavor-dependent for hyperons. Meanwhile, vector meson spin alignment depends on the hadronization mechanisms of initially polarized quarks and anti-quarks. Medium anisotropy significantly changes the degree of spin polarization compared to the magnetic field and baryon chemical potential."

In particular we investigate how the presence of a dark matter component influences the mass-radius relation, the value of the maximum mass of a neutron star and other stellar properties. To model ordinary matter we use a state-of-the-art equation of state of $\\beta$-stable nuclear matter obtained using the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock quantum many-body approach starting from two-body and three-body nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory. The dark matter component of the star is modeled as a non-self-annihilating system of spin $1/2$ fermions at zero temperature and its equation of state as an ideal relativistic Fermi gas. The equilibrium configurations of these dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANS) are calculated by solving a generalization of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to the case where the system consists of two perfect fluids interacting solely through gravity. We find that, depending on the dark matter particle mass $m_\\chi$, one can have somehow opposite effects on the stellar properties. In the case $m_\\chi = 1\\, \\mathrm{GeV}$, the stellar gravitational maximum mass $M_{max}$ decreases, whereas in the case $m_\\chi = 0.1\\, \\mathrm{GeV}$, $M_{max}$ increases with respect to the maximum mass of ordinary neutron stars.

In this study, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the angular structure of inclusive jets and $\\gamma$+jets using a transport approach that accounts for jet energy loss and the medium response in the quark-gluon plasma. We examine the girth modification of $\\gamma$+jets in $0-30\\%$ PbPb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV, achieving satisfactory agreement with recent CMS measurements. We explore the relationship between selection bias and jet kinematics by varying the threshold for $x_{j\\gamma} = p_T^{\\rm jet}/p_T^{\\gamma}$. Notably, we quantitatively demonstrate that $\\gamma$+jets significantly reduce selection bias and can effectively select jets that have been sufficiently quenched in PbPb collisions, which is crucial for capture the jet angular broadening. Additionally, we estimate the contributions of medium-induced gluon radiation and the medium response to the broadening of the jet angular substructure. Lastly, we analyze the modification patterns of jet $R_g$ and $\\Delta R_{\\rm axis}$ in PbPb collisions, which indicate slight broadening for $\\gamma$+jets and noticeable narrowing for inclusive jets compared to pp collisions."
