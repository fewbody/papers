Recently, the NA61/SHINE collaboration reported an unexpectedly large isospin-violating charged-to-neutral kaon ratio in Ar-Sc heavy-ion collisions (HIC).Using a quark recombination approach, we introduce a function of kaon multiplicities that reduces to unity in the isospin-symmetric limit independently of the scattering energy and type of nuclei. Using this quantity, we show that nucleus-nucleus collisions violate isospin sizably (at the $6.4\\sigma$--level), while proton-proton data on kaon multiplicities do not. We predict other isospin-violating enhancements in HIC, such as the proton-to-neutron ratio $p/n \\sim 1.2$ and the hyperon ratio $\\Sigma^{+}/\\Sigma^{-}\\sim1.4$. Finally, we extend the approach to antiquarks in the initial state, useful for e.g. pion-nucleus scattering reactions."

      "summary": "arXiv:2504.02192v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Noncentral heavy-ion collisions create fireballs with large initial orbital angular momentum that is expected to induce strong vorticity in the hot bulk fluid and generate global spin polarization of the produced particles. As the collision beam energy $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ decreases to approach the two-nucleon-mass threshold, this initial angular momentum approaches zero. One may thus expect that the observed global spin polarization should reach a maximum and then drop to zero as increased stopping competes with decreased initial momentum. Recent experimental measurements, however, appear to show a continual rise of hyperon polarization even down to $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} =$ 2.42 GeV, suggesting a peak very near threshold which is difficult to interpret and calls for a better understanding of angular momentum initial conditions, especially at low energy. Here, we develop a new Glauber-based initial state model (\"Glauber+\") to investigate the initial distribution of angular momentum with respect to rapidity as well as the dependence of this distribution on initial baryon stopping across a wide range of collisional beam energy. We estimate that the angular momentum per produced final charged particle at mid-rapidity peaks around 5 GeV, which may present a potential challenge to an interpretation of the spin polarization measurements near threshold as being a consequence of the initial angular momentum of the colliding system."

Two different versions of the proton-neutron quasi particle random phase (pn-QRPA) model were employed to compute $\\beta$-decay rates and half-lives for the N = 126 isotones. The first set of calculation solves the pn-QRPA equations using the schematic model (SM) approach. The Woods-Saxon potential was employed as a mean-field basis. A spherical shape assigned for each waiting point nuclei throughout all simulations. Both allowed Gamow-Teller (GT) and first-forbidden (FF) transitions were considered in the particle-hole (ph) channel. The second set uses the pn-QRPA model in deformed Nilsson basis to calculate $\\beta$-decay rates for allowed GT and unique first-forbidden (U1F) transitions under terrestrial and stellar conditions. Our results are in agreement with shell model findings that first-forbidden transitions lead to a considerable decrement in the calculated half-lives of the isotones. Inclusion of the first-forbidden contribution led to a decent agreement of our computed terrestrial $\\beta$-decay half-lives with measured ones, much better than the previous calculations. The possible implication of the waiting point nuclei on r-process nucleosynthesis is discussed briefly."

Prior to the collapse, lepton emissions significantly affect the cooling of the core and reduce its entropy. Therefore, the lepton emission rates for Fe-group nuclei serve as an important input for core-collapse simulations of high-mass stars.\n  From earlier simulation studies, isotopes of vanadium (V) have great astrophysical significance in regard to their weak-decay rates, which substantially affect $Y_e$ (fraction of lepton to baryon number) during the final developmental stages of massive stars. The current study involves the computation of the weak lepton emission (LE) rates for V isotopes by employing the improved deformed proton-neutron Quasi-particle Random Phase Approximation (pn-QRPA) model. The mass numbers of the selected isotopes range from 43 to 64. The LE rates on these isotopes have been estimated for a broad spectrum of density and temperature under astrophysical conditions. The ranges considered for density and temperature are $10^1$ to $10^{11}$ (g/cm$^3$) and $10^7$ to $3 \\times 10^{11}$ (K), respectively.\n  The lepton emission rates from the present study were also compared to the rates previously estimated by using the independent-particle model (IPM) and large-scale shell model (LSSM). IPM rates are generally bigger than QRPA rates, while LSSM rates overall show a good comparison with the reported rates."

With the assumption that the nuclear surface deformation induced by the multi-nucleon dynamics is simulated by bosonic degrees of freedom, the interacting-boson Hamiltonian that provides energy spectra and wave functions is determined by mapping the potential energy surface that is obtained from self-consistent mean-field calculations based on the energy density functional onto the corresponding energy surface of the boson system. This procedure has been shown to be valid in general cases of the quadrupole collective states, and has allowed for systematic studies on spectroscopic properties of medium-heavy and heavy nuclei, including those that are far from the line of $\\beta$ stability. The method is extended to study intriguing nuclear structure phenomena that include shape phase transitions and coexistence, octupole deformation and collectivity, and the coupling of the single-particle to collective degrees of freedom, which is crucial to describe structures of odd nuclei, and $\\beta$ and $\\beta\\beta$ decays."

In this work, a multilayer perceptron and autoencoder (MLP + AE) hybrid neural network method is introduced to extract preformation factors within the generalized liquid drop model and experimental data. A K-fold cross validation method is also adopted. The accuracy of the preformation factor calculated by this improved neural network is comparable to the results of the empirical formula. MLP + AE can effectively capture the linear relationship between the logarithm of the preformation factor and the square root of the ratio of the decay energy, further verifying that Geiger-Nuttall law can deal with preformation factor. The extracted preformation probability of isotope and isotone chains show different trends near the magic number, and in addition, an odd-even staggering effect appears. This means that the preformation factors are affected by closed shells and unpaired nucleons. Therefore the preformation factors can provide nuclear structure information. Furthermore, for 41 new nuclides, the half-lives introduced with the preformation factors reproduce the experimental values as expected. Finally, the preformation factors and {\\alpha}-decay half-lives of Z = 119 and 120 superheavy nuclei are predicted."

Measurements have been performed at RHIC and LHC, but the conclusion has been elusive in the absence of quantitative calculations for both scenarios. We address this issue by employing a recently developed formalism of density correlations and incorporate resonance decays, local charge conservation, and experimental kinematic cuts. We find that the hadron gas scenario is in fair agreement with the ALICE data for $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions only when a very short rapidity range of local charge conservation is enforced, while the QGP scenario is in excellent agreement with experimental data and largely insensitive to the range of local charge conservation. A Bayesian analysis of the data utilizing different priors yields moderate evidence for the freeze-out of charge fluctuations in the QGP phase relative to hadron gas. The upcoming high-fidelity measurements from LHC Run 2 will serve as a precision test of the two scenarios."

      "summary": "Quantum chromodynamics admits a CP violating contribution to the action, the θ term, which is expected to give rise to a nonvanishing electric dipole moment of the neutron. Despite intensive search, no CP violations have been found in the strong interaction. This puzzle is referred to as the strong CP problem. There is evidence that CP is conserved in the confining theory, to the extent that color charges are totally screened for θ > 0 at large distances. It is not immediately obvious that this implies a vanishing dipole moment though. With this Letter I will close the gap. It is shown that in the infinite volume hadron correlation functions decouple from the topological charge, expressed in terms of the zero modes. The reason is that hadrons have a limited range of interaction, while the density of zero modes vanishes with the inverse root of the volume, thus reducing the probability of finding a zero mode in the vicinity to zero. This implies that CP is conserved in the strong interaction."
