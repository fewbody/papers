Here, the focus was on reactions with protons or $\\alpha$ particles as required for nucleosynthesis in proton-rich matter. For completeness, also neutron-induced reactions are provided for the same set of targets. Some comments on dependencies of rates on various nuclear properties and on the appropriate way to compare to experiments are given. The new rate set for charged-particle induced reactions provides a better description of experimental data than previously widely used rates, especially for reactions involving $\\alpha$ particles."

Most importantly, isobaric systems that differ in their nuclear structure offer valuable insights into the underlying nuclear geometries, making them powerful tools to probe the role of nuclear structure using heavy ion collisions. We study the initial state and evolution of the hot and dense medium formed in Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at 200A GeV at RHIC using a relativistic hydrodynamical model. The initial geometry of the two isobaric collisions is found to influence the evolution of the hot and dense medium produced. The sensitivity of photon production, charged particle spectra and anisotropic flow coefficients ($v_n$) to the initial geometry, including different orientations of the isobaric set have been studied in detail. Significant variations in anisotropic flow of photons and hadrons are observed, highlighting the role of nuclear deformation in shaping final state observables. Moreover, photon anisotropic flow is found to be considerably more sensitive to the initial state than charged particle anisotropic flow, indicating that photon measurements in isobaric collisions have strong potential to constrain initial state modeling and improve our understanding of QGP properties in such systems."

      "summary": "arXiv:2512.03776v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Background: Properties of giant dipole resonances (GDRs), along with other nuclear resonances, provide valuable tools for refining theoretical models as they reflect collective features of nuclear matter. Among such collective phenomena is octupole deformation, whose impact on resonance features, however, is less studied. Purpose: Investigate the effect of reflection-symmetry-breaking octupole deformation on electric and magnetic transition strengths in atomic nuclei. Methods: Calculations were performed using linear response theory with the iterative finite amplitude method (FAM) to solve quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA)-type equations. Underlying ground-state solutions were obtained within the framework of axially symmetric Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) using three different Skyrme functionals. Results: Electric and magnetic multipole responses were calculated for octupole-deformed even-even Rn, Ra, Th, U, Pu, and Cm isotopes. Calculations were performed on top of two distinct deformed ground-state solutions: one constrained to conserve parity, and the other allowing parity breaking. Sum rules were calculated from $M1$ transition strengths and compared with the expected correlations to certain ground-state properties. Conclusions: Based on our results, the octupole deformation has only a modest effect on the transition strengths in the resonances. In turn, $M1$ transition strengths have a greater effect at lower energies (0-8 MeV), which encourages further investigation. Isoscalar $E3$ transition strength was confirmed to have a significant contribution from the rotational Nambu-Goldstone (NG) mode in the parity-breaking HFB solution, and thus, removing it was found necessary."

We work within the $\\Phi-$derivable approach to the thermodynamic potential. The formula takes the form of an energy-momentum integral over a statistical distribution function times a unique spectral density. In the near mass-shell limit, the spectral density reduces, contrary to na\\\"{i}ve expectations, not to a Lorentzian but rather to a \"squared Lorentzian\" shape. The relation of the Beth-Uhlenbeck formula to the $\\Phi$-derivable approach is exact at the two-loop level for $\\Phi$. The formalism we develop, which extends the Beth-Uhlenbeck approach beyond the low-density limit, includes Mott dissociation of bound states, in accordance with Levinson's theorem, and the self-consistent back reaction of correlations in the fermion propagation. We discuss applications to further systems, such as quark matter and nuclear matter."

      "summary": "arXiv:2512.03157v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Precision spectroscopic measurements of isotope shifts have recently reached a high level of accuracy. Tests of King non-linearity (NL) along isotope chains have been proposed as a tool to search for fifth-force mediators. At the same time, these tests can potentially teach us about the structure of heavy nuclei at unprecedented precision, where King NL has already been observed in several systems. A robust interpretation of the existing data, however, is hampered by incomplete control over the Standard Model (SM) contributions. We develop a systematic effective field theory framework, matching the SM onto scalar non-relativistic QED in the infinite nuclear mass limit and then onto quantum-mechanical potentials. This approach organizes all nuclear effects into a small set of Wilson coefficients and cleanly separates short- and long-distance physics. We show that the commonly used treatment of the $\\langle r^2\\rangle^2$ term needs to be reconsidered, as it arises only at second-order in perturbation theory, and we derive the long-range $1/r^4$ potential from nuclear polarizability. Applying the framework to hydrogen-like systems, we provide a transparent classification of SM sources of King NL relevant for current and future isotope-shift experiments. The formalism can be applied to learn about the shape of the heavy scalar nuclei at a higher level of precision and detail than what was previously attainable."

The relaxation time from nonequilibrium to equilibrium in the QCD phase diagram is extracted from the Langevin simulations of the QCD-assisted relaxation dynamic model. It is found that in a narrow region along the phase boundary radiated from the CEP, the relaxation time is enhanced significantly. Outside this narrow region, the relaxation time drops drastically, which implies that the dynamic critical region is small in the QCD phase diagram. We also find that the effects of critical slowing down are mild on the chemical freeze-out curves."

      "summary": "arXiv:2512.03894v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The standard parity doublet model with its mass-mixing mechanism fails to describe the axial charge $g_A$ of the nucleon. While $g_A = 1$ in the original Gell-Mann--Levy model, which reproduces the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly of QCD, in the presence of a chirally invariant baryon mass the mass mixing leads to $g_A < 1 $ whereas phenomenologically it is about 1.28. We propose to remedy this problem by introducing kinetic-mixing terms corresponding to meson-baryon derivative couplings, similar in spirit to the two-mixing-angle scenario of the $\\eta$-$\\eta'$ mixing. This extended parity doublet model contains five parameters in the effective baryonic Lagrangian. Three of them can be determined by using the empirical results for the axial charge of the nucleon together with the masses of the nucleon and its parity partner, the $N^*(1535)$ resonance. We discuss various options how to determine the remaining parameters, touching upon the mass of both parity partners if the chiral condensate is put to zero; the mass of the nucleon in the chiral limit; and the values of meson-baryon coupling constants related to the decays of the resonance to pion-nucleon and sigma-nucleon."

No termwise expansion, short of the exact theory itself, can be both conserving and crossing symmetric. This work applies the Kraichnan embedded-Hamiltonian formalism for strongly coupled systems to investigate consistency of the interplay between purely pair-mediated correlations and pair-irreducible ones. The approach sheds a different light on the issue of crossing symmetry versus conservation. In the process, the parquet equations acquire a different formulation."

The linearized equations of motion lead to a dispersion equation for the wobbling frequency. We define a ground band with energies consisting of a rotational part and one half of the vibrational wobbling energy. Adding to each state energy the corresponding wobbling quanta, one obtains the first excited band. Phonon amplitudes are used to calculate the reduced probability for the inter-band M1 transitions. The states exhibit a shears character. We point out a chiral symmetry that is broken by the interaction term, leading to a pair of twin chiral bands. Applications are made for 156Gd. We outline the ability of the two-rotor model to account for the wobbling and chiral motion in nuclei. Although the chosen trial function does not have a definite total angular momentum, for two particular ansatz of the pairs Ip, In, the average value of the total angular momentum approximates, to a certain accuracy, the partial angular momentum Ip.

      "summary": "Machine learning methods, in particular deep learning methods such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) with many layers, have become widespread and useful tools in nuclear physics. However, these ANNs are typically treated as ‘black boxes’, with their architecture (width, depth, and weight/bias initialization) and the training algorithm and parameters chosen empirically by optimizing learning based on limited exploration. We test a non-empirical approach to understanding and optimizing nuclear physics ANNs by adapting a criticality analysis based on renormalization group flows in terms of the hyperparameters for weight/bias initialization, training rates, and the ratio of depth to width. This treatment utilizes the statistical properties of neural network initialization to find a generating functional for network outputs at any layer, allowing for a path integral formulation of the ANN outputs as a Euclidean statistical field theory. We use a prototypical example to test the applicability of this approach: a simple ANN for nuclear binding energies. We find that with training using a stochastic gradient descent optimizer, the predicted criticality behavior is realized, and optimal performance is found with critical tuning. However, the use of an adaptive learning algorithm leads to somewhat superior results without concern for tuning and thus obscures the analysis. Nevertheless, the criticality analysis offers a way to look within the black box of ANNs, which is a first step towards potential improvements in network performance beyond using adaptive optimizers."

The calculation is performed in nuclear matter by solving the Bethe–Goldstone equation with the realistic Granada 2013 nucleon–nucleon potential, including both one-body and two-body meson-exchange currents (MEC) of seagull, pion-in-flight, and Δ types. We find that MEC produce a sizable enhancement of the transverse response in the 1p1h channel when acting on correlated nucleon pairs with high-momentum components generated by SRC. This is in contrast to the uncorrelated case, where MEC—dominated by the Δ current—can even yield a negative effect. The results are consistent with previous findings based on the correlated basis function approach, supporting the interpretation that SRC play a central role in the transverse response enhancement from MEC."

This result improves upon the previous best limit by approximately one order of magnitude. For the axion–photon coupling, the first dark matter direct detection (DMDD) experimental constraint on the product of the effective axion–nucleon coupling and the axion–photon coupling ( ) is derived through the inverse Primakoff effect. The result provides the most stringent limit for MA in 3.3 (4.6) × 10−5 to 1 × 10−3 keV, with a screening length r0 = 2.45 (0.49) Å. It sets the first limit for MA in 1.0 × 10−3–14.4 keV, which significantly extends the parameter space of ( ).

The study involves the analysis of the experimental fusion cross-section (FCS) data in energy range 6.92 ≤ Ecm ≤ 13.83 MeV, which includes the Coulomb barrier region Ecm = 10.0–11.92 MeV. Apart from an excellent description of the existing FCS data in the studied energy range, the associated hindrance, characterized by the S-factor reaching a maximum and then gradually falling off at lower energies, so far suggested empirically for the system, is reproduced down to 4 MeV for the first time in the simple OPM. An S-factor maximum of S0 = 3.15 × 1025 MeV.b at E0 = 7.14 MeV is observed with T ≃ 2.6 GK, which conforms to the values reported for quiescent and explosive burning. Our reaction rate, deduced from the NM potential, compares well with the Caughlan and Fowler data. Dominant partial waves implicit in the observed maximum S-factor in the studied Gamow range are also explored. Our present findings, with the success of NM potentials, suggest that the nucleus–nucleus potential is non-monotonic."

      "summary": "When the spins of deuteron and triton are aligned in parallel, the fusion cross-section increases by approximately 50%. The emitted neutrons are anisotropic and polarized in specific directions. The polarized neutron beams can be used to measure strong magnetic fields in high-energy-density plasmas, offering a potential alternative to the well-established proton imaging technique. In contrast to protons, neutrons are not deflected by electromagnetic fields and are not sensitive to electric fields, thus reducing the complexity of magnetic field reconstruction. Three-dimensional spin transport hydrodynamics simulations are employed to investigate the polarized neutron beams generated from spin-polarized deuterium-tritium target implosions. Synthetic polarized neutron images of magnetic fields are generated from Monte Carlo simulations. Based on a comparison of the results of finite-size sources and an ideal point source, a method to compensate the finite-source-size blurring effect is proposed to reduce the error in magnetic field reconstruction."

      "summary": "Event-by-event fluctuations in the initial energy density of nuclear collisions lead to the decorrelation of second order flow vector, which is known as its transverse-momentum ( ) and pseudorapidity (η) dependence as observed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Existing measurements at the CERN Large Hadron Collider showed that these decorrelations are also observed in small collision systems. In this work, a systematic study of the transverse-momentum- and pseudorapidity-dependent flow vector decorrelation is performed in p–Pb collisions at the 5.02 TeV with A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model using different tunings of initial conditions and partonic and hadronic interactions. The string-melting version of the AMPT model provides a reasonable description of the measured flow vector decorrelation as a function of and η. We demonstrate that hadronic scatterings do not have a significant effect on decorrelation in p–Pb collisions for different centrality selections, while both initial conditions and partonic interactions affect the magnitude of the decorrelations. In addition, we found that the subtraction of the nonflow, especially the long-range jet correlation, is crucial for the accurate extraction of flow vector decorrelation in small collision systems. The comparison of data and model presented in this paper provide further insights in understanding the fluctuations of the flow vector with and η in small collision systems and has referential value for future measurements."

      "summary": "Medium modifications of γ-triggered jets are investigated with the linear Boltzmann transport model in heavy-ion collisions with varying system sizes, focusing on centrality dependence in Pb+Pb and Xe+Xe collisions at the LHC. Our numerical results reveal that jets produced in central collisions exhibit a wider transverse asymmetry ( ) distribution, broader jet shape, and more pronounced γ-jet transverse momentum imbalance ( ) compared with peripheral collisions. These effects arise from the longer path length and stronger jet-medium interactions in central collisions, leading to enhanced jet quenching and medium response. Our findings demonstrate that the magnitude of γ-jet modifications is sensitive to the size and centrality of the collision system, with larger systems inducing more significant alterations owing to increased energy loss and medium feedback."

      "summary": "This paper presents a systematic study of hyperon non-leptonic two-body decays induced by light quark transitions, particularly the process, within the framework of SU(3) flavor symmetry. The effective weak Hamiltonian is decomposed into irreducible SU(3) representations, including the 27-plet and octet components, and applied to analyze decays of octet and decuplet baryons and charmed baryons. Both the irreducible representation amplitude (IRA) approach and the topological diagrammatic analysis (TDA) are employed to construct decay amplitudes and constrain the parameter space. SU(3) symmetry-breaking effects arising from the strange quark mass are incorporated systematically. A global fit to current experimental data allows us to extract form factors and predict branching ratios and asymmetry parameters for several decay channels. Our results demonstrate the predictive power of SU(3) flavor symmetry while highlighting significant symmetry-breaking effects, especially in amplitudes related to the 27-plet. Notably, the decay channel exhibits a deviation exceeding from experimental measurements, suggesting the possible presence of new decay mechanisms or contributions beyond the Standard Model. Besides, we also evaluate the size of symmetry breaking. However, the large uncertainty of the experimental data makes it difficult to precisely determine the value of symmetry breaking. We strongly recommend that future experimental efforts aim to reduce the measurement uncertainties, especially for the processes and , which have larger experimental errors compared to other data and play an important role in determining the symmetry breaking parameter. This study provides a systematic framework for future tests of the Standard Model and the search for new physics in hyperon decays."

Low-lying energy levels of these nuclei with both positive and negative parities, as well as transition rates and g factors of some low-lying states, are calculated. Most of them agree closely with experimental data. The wave functions of yrast , , , states and negative parity and states of these nuclei are discussed in detail. The NPA calculations show that many of these states have a simple structure in the nucleon-pair basis."

      "summary": "Clustering, as a fundamental dynamical feature existing widely in many-body systems, has aroused tremendous interest in nuclear physics over the last few decades. The α-cluster concept has been used successfully to describe the energy spectra and electromagnetic transitions for a series of nuclei above the doubly magic core. In the present study, we have systematically investigated the spectroscopic properties of three-nucleon and α-cluster states in 19F and 21Ne within the binary cluster-core model (BCM) plus the extra spin-orbit potential. The calculated energy levels and electromagnetic transition strengths, with few exceptions, are in good agreement with experimental data, confirming the reliability and integrity of BCM. Furthermore, such a BCM is extended to the case of cluster states approaching shell closures in heavier nuclei, such as 43Sc, 59Cu, and 93Mo, leading to satisfactory reproductions and predictions on energy levels and reduced transition rates. It is expected that the present study can provide further insight into the cluster degrees of freedom in odd-A nuclei."

      "authors": "Mikael Chala, Luis Gil, Zhe Ren and 哲 任",

      "summary": "We perform the first computation of phase-transition parameters to cubic order in , where m is the scalar mass and T is the temperature, in a simple model resembling the Higgs sector of the SMEFT. We use dimensional reduction, including 1-loop matching corrections for terms of dimension 6 (in 4-dimensional units), 2-loop contributions for dimension-4 ones and 3-loops for the squared mass. We precisely quantify the size of the different corrections, including renormalization-group running as well as quantum effects from light fields in the effective theory provided by the Coleman-Weinberg potential, and discuss briefly the implications for gravitational waves. Our results suggest that, for strong phase transitions, 1-loop corrections from dimension-6 operators can compete with 2-loop ones from quartic couplings and largely surpass those from 3-loop thermal masses."
