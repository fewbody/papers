The states exhibit a shears character. One points out a chiral symmetry which is broken by the interaction term, leading to a pair of twin chiral bands. Applications are made for $^{156}$Gd. One outlines the ability of the two rotor model to account for the wobbling and chiral motion in nuclei. Although the chosen trial function has not a definite total angular momentum, for two particular ansatz of the pairs $I_p,I_n$ the average value of the total angular momentum approximates,\n  to a certain accuracy, the partial angular momentum $I_p$ In this context, the rotational bands defined throughout this present paper could be labeled by the total I."

      "summary": "arXiv:2510.26455v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Charting the phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at large density is a challenging task due to the complex action problem in lattice simulations. Through simulations at imaginary baryon chemical potential $\\mu_B$ we observe that, if the strangeness neutrality condition is imposed, both the strangeness chemical potential $\\mu_S/\\mu_B$ and the strangeness susceptibility $\\chi_2^S$ take on constant values at the chiral transition for varying $\\mu_B$. We present new lattice data to extrapolate contours of constant $\\mu_S/\\mu_B$ or $\\chi_2^S$ to finite baryon chemical potential. We argue that they are good proxies for the QCD crossover because, as we show, they are only mildly influenced by criticality and by finite volume effects. We obtain continuum limits for these proxies up to $\\mu_B = 400$ MeV, through a next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO) Taylor expansion based on large-statistics data on $16^3 \\times 8$, $20^3 \\times 10$ and $24^3 \\times 12$ lattices with our 4HEX improved staggered action. We show that these are in excellent agreement with existing results for the chiral transition and, strikingly, also with analogous contours obtained with the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model. On the $16^3 \\times 8$ lattice, we carry out the expansion up to next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^4$LO), and extend the extrapolation beyond $\\mu_B=500$ MeV, again finding perfect agreement with the HRG model. This suggests that the crossover line constructed from this proxy starts deviating from the chemical freeze-out line near $\\mu_B\\approx500$ MeV, as expected but not yet observed."

The framework has been validated against a variety of benchmark processes, demonstrating robustness and flexibility for phenomenological studies. A key advantage of this implementation is its seamless integration with existing MadGraph5_aMC@NLO features, allowing computations not only within the Standard Model but also in a wide range of Beyond the Standard Model or Effective Field Theory scenarios via a modified Universal Feynman Output (UFO) interface. Furthermore, the framework maintains compatibility with standard Monte Carlo event generators for parton showering and hadronisation. Through numerous examples, we highlight that theoretical studies of quarkonium processes require careful consideration: the impact of subleading contributions is often difficult to predict using simple counting arguments based solely on the hierarchy of couplings and velocity-scaling rules."

In this Letter, we present an improved model-independent analysis of these radiative corrections, including, for the first time, effects beyond point-like pions in the evaluation of the loop diagrams. These structure-dependent corrections, implemented via a dispersive representation of the pion form factor, lead to significant changes compared to previous calculations due to enhancements near the $\\rho(770)$ resonance. We also devise strategies for the matching to chiral perturbation theory and a stable implementation of the real corrections down to the two-pion threshold, which shows that some higher-order isospin-breaking corrections need to be kept due to a strong threshold enhancement. Finally, we perform dispersive fits to the currently available $\\tau\\to\\pi\\pi\\nu_\\tau$ spectra and discuss the consequences for isospin-breaking corrections in the evaluation of $a_\\mu^\\text{HVP, LO}[\\pi\\pi,\\tau]$."

The presence of a trapping potential introduces a new characteristic physical scale in the superfluid EFT which, inter alia, describes the acoustic branch of excitations in the far infrared well below the scale of the superfluid gap. In this EFT there is a clear hierarchy of scales, and corrections to the homogeneous system due to the trapping potential may be organized into three regions with distinct power counting that relies on both the EFT derivative expansion, and the WKB approximation, which is an expansion in gradients of the trapping potential. The energy spectrum of the superfluid system is obtained in each of the regions by explicit computation of the phonon-field fluctuations, and by the modifications to the dynamic structure factor due to the corresponding density fluctuations. The most significant deviations from linear dispersion due to the trapping potential are found in the far infrared region of the superfluid EFT."

In a phenomenological model, we find consistency with a double $t$-channel exchange process where anti-baryons are created only at the middle vertex.

To date, PPM and EOS inference have been carried out as two separate steps, with the former using EOS-agnostic priors. This approach has several drawbacks. Ideally, one would perform a fully hierarchical Bayesian inference where the pulse profile and EOS model parameters are jointly fit, but implementing such a framework is complex and computationally demanding. Here, we present an intermediate solution introducing an EOS-informed prior on mass-radius into the existing PPM pipeline using normalizing flows. By focusing on the parameter space consistent with certain EOSs, this approach both tightens constraints on neutron star parameters while reducing computational costs and requiring minimal additional implementation effort. We test this approach on two pulsars, PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0437-4715, and with two EOS model families: a model based on the speed of sound inside the neutron star interior (CS) and a piecewise-polytropic (PP) model. Both EOS models implement constraints from chiral effective field theory calculations of dense matter. For both pulsar datasets, the inferred radius credible intervals are narrower than in the EOS-agnostic case, with CS favoring smaller radii and PP favoring larger radii. For PSR J0437-4715, the EOS-informed priors reveal a new, more extreme geometric mode that is statistically favored but physically questionable. Including the PPM posteriors in the subsequent EOS inference further tightens the mass-radius posteriors through the chiral effective field theory constraints. However, there is also a sensitivity to the high-density extensions, where the PP (CS) model produces a shift towards larger (smaller) radii and corresponding stiffening (softening) of the pressure-energy density relation."

      "summary": "The thermodynamic properties of an ideal bosonic system composed of particles and antiparticles at finite temperatures are examined within the framework of a scalar field model. It is assumed that particle–antiparticle pair creation occurs; however, the system is simultaneously subject to exact charge (isospin) conservation. To implement this constraint, we first consider the system within the Grand Canonical Ensemble and then transform to the Canonical Ensemble using a Legendre transformation. This procedure provides a formally consistent scheme for incorporating the chemical potential at the microscopic level into the Canonical Ensemble framework. To enforce exact conservation of charge (isospin, NI), we further analyze the thermodynamic properties of the system within the extended Canonical Ensemble , in which the chemical potential becomes a thermodynamic function of the temperature and conserved charge. It is shown that as the temperature decreases, the system undergoes a second-order phase transition to a Bose–Einstein condensate at the critical temperature Tc, but only when the conserved charge is finite, NI = const ≠ 0. In a particle–antiparticle system, the condensate forms exclusively in the component with the dominant particle number density, which determines the excess charge. We demonstrate that the symmetry breaking of the ground state at T = 0 results from a first-order phase transition associated with the formation of a Bose–Einstein condensate . Although the transition involves symmetry breaking, it is not spontaneous in the strict field-theoretic sense, but is instead induced by the external injection of particles. Potential experimental signals of Bose–Einstein condensation of pions produced in high-energy nuclear collisions are briefly discussed."

      "summary": "We present two iterations of the Multicusp Ion Source Technology at MIT (MIST) sources, designed to fulfill the requirements of the HCHC-XX cyclotron design. The HCHC-XX is a novel compact cyclotron accelerating . Beam is injected through a radio-frequency quadrupole buncher-accelerator (embedded in the cyclotron yoke) and utilizes so-called vortex motion during acceleration. If successful, it will deliver 10 mA of protons at 60 MeV in CW mode. This scheme requires a low-emittance, high-current initial beam with high purity. We briefly summarize the design and previous results of the MIST-1 ion source and, for the first time, the detailed design of the new and improved MIST-2, including the mechanical, electrical, and control system design. We further show experimental results of using the MIST-2 backplate on the MIST-1 body, present a study using different types of permanent magnets for confinement (including no magnets), and finally, we present first results of the MIST-2 in full operation. In this first commissioning run, we were able to increase the total extracted current from the MIST-2 to 7 mA—a factor of 2 over the MIST-1."
