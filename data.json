Particularly, using the Faddeev formalism in configuration space, the $\\phi NN$ system, and $^{9}_{\\phi}$Be and $^{6}_{\\phi\\phi}$He nuclei within the framework of the three-body cluster model, are investigated. The $\\phi\\alpha$ effective potential, obtained through a folding procedure, involves the HAL QCD $\\phi N$ interaction in the $^4S_{3/2}$ channel which does not lead to a bound state of the $\\phi N$ pair while the $\\phi N$ $^2S_{1/2}$ channel yields the bound state as the $^3_\\phi$H nucleus.

The folding potential is approximated by the Woods-Saxon formula.

The notions of self-consistent shape and spin polarisations due to odd nucleons, which are responsible for generating total electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole moments, were transformed into detailed computational procedures. The alignment of intrinsic angular momentum along the axis of axial symmetry, necessitating signature and time-reversal symmetry breaking, followed by the restoration of rotational symmetry, proved to be essential components of the method. In contrast, the restoration of particle number symmetry yields modifications of only about 1%. With the isovector spin-spin terms of the functional previously adjusted in near doubly magic nuclei across the mass chart, the calculations were parameter-free. Effective charges and $g$-factors were not employed. A reasonably good agreement was achieved between the calculated and measured electric quadrupole moments.

In this work we show that even in the presence of explicit symmetry breaking terms in the nuclear force, as much as 90% of the spin-isospin structure of light nuclei is captured by a single SU(4) irreducible representation. We also dissect one- and two-body axial current operators derived from chiral effective field theory ($\\chi$EFT) and prove that they are largely block diagonal in the SU(4) representation, suppressing weak transitions between different representations.

In this work, we propose to measure the medium-induced modifications of the elliptic anisotropy inside jets in relativistic heavy-ion collisions to provide novel insight into the jet quenching phenomenon. By simulating the jet propagation in the hot and dense nuclear medium with a Linear Boltzmann Transport model, we observe a de-correlation in the two-particle azimuthal angular distribution for inclusive jet production in AA collisions relative to that in pp collisions, which results in significant suppression of the in-jet elliptic anisotropy coefficient $v_2$. This phenomenon arises from the stochastic and strong interactions with the thermal QGP medium undergone by the jet particles. Furthermore, the nuclear modifications of the in-jet $v_2$ are found to be sensitive to the medium properties in the model study, which provide a potential probe for the jet tomography of nuclear matter."

In the limit $N\\to\\infty$, phase transitions emerge as classical shock waves in the space of thermodynamic variables. Near critical points, we argue that the volume density exhibits a scaling behavior consistent with the Universality Conjecture in viscous transport PDEs. As an application, we employ our framework to nuclear matter and construct a global QCD phase diagram revealing critical points for the nuclear liquid-gas and hadron gas-QGP transitions. We demonstrate how finite-size effects smear critical signatures, indicating the importance of thoughtful considerations in the search for the QCD critical point."

In the generalized CPS formulation for the mapping Hamiltonian of the classical mapping model with commutator variables (CMMcv) method [\\textit{J. Phys. Chem.

Such a phase space structure allows for exact trajectory-based dynamics for pure discrete (electronic) degrees of freedom (DOFs), where the equations of motion of each trajectory are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation. We employ covariant kernels {within the generalized CPS framework} to develop two approaches that naturally yield exact evaluation of time correlation functions (TCFs) for pure discrete (electronic) DOFs. In addition, we briefly discuss the phase space mapping formalisms where the contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression of the {TCF} of population dynamics is strictly positive semi-definite. The generalized CPS formulation also indicates that the equations of motion in phase space mapping model I of our previous work [\\textit{J. Chem.

Two building blocks are needed to construct all these TMDs at the operator level: the sea quark TMD operator which appears in semi-inclusive Deep-Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS) or in the Drell-Yan process and the elastic $S$-matrix for a quark-antiquark dipole. Compared to SIDIS, the saturation effects are stronger for dijet production in forward proton-nucleus collisions, due to additional scattering in the initial and final state, effectively resulting in a larger value for the nuclear saturation momentum."

The Cross-Section for Cosmic Rays at CERN workshop series has addressed the challenges encountered in the interpretation of high-precision cosmic-ray data, with the goal of strengthening emergent synergies and taking advantage of the complementarity and know-how in different communities, from theoretical and experimental astroparticle physics to high-energy and nuclear physics. In this paper, we present the outcomes of the third edition of the workshop that took place in 2024. We present the current state of cosmic-ray experiments and their perspectives, and provide a detailed road map to close the most urgent gaps in cross-section data, in order to efficiently progress on many open physics cases, which are motivated in the paper. Finally, with the aim of being as exhaustive as possible, this report touches several other fields -- such as cosmogenic studies, space radiation protection and hadrontherapy -- where overlapping and specific new cross-section measurements, as well as nuclear code improvement and benchmarking efforts, are also needed.

We compute the thermodynamical quantities of interest and in particular the sound velocity squared, showing that it presents a maximum for an isospin chemical potential similar to the one reported by lattice QCD results and also with a similar height.

Considering the effect of rotations, lattice QCD data shows that the temperatures for deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration should increase with real angular velocity, and the dominant effects are related to gluonic degrees of freedom. These findings could be essential for quark models in rotating systems that lack gluonic interactions, which predicts the decreasing of the chiral temperature transition with the angular velocity. To address this issue properly, in this work we apply the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model to explore the phase diagram in a rotating rigid cylinder with constant angular velocity in the mean field approximation. To circumvent the absence of gluons, we propose the application of an effective coupling dependent of the angular velocity, fitted to match the pseudocritical temperature of chiral phase transition in the model through lattice QCD data. Our results indicate that the running coupling induces the enhancement of the chiral condensate as a function of angular velocity, strengthening the breaking of chiral symmetry, an effect previously dubbed as chiral vortical catalysis. For the chiral susceptibility we observe stronger fluctuations around the transition temperature when we consider the running coupling. The phase diagram is affected by these findings shifting the critical end point (CEP) to higher temperatures and chemical potentials."

      "summary": "arXiv:2501.03318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Using first-principles field-theoretic methods, we investigate neutrino emission from strongly magnetized dense quark matter under conditions relevant to compact stars. We develop a customized approximation that fully accounts for the Landau-level quantization of electron states while neglecting such quantization for quarks. This approach is well-justified in dense quark matter, where the chemical potentials of up and down quarks significantly exceed those of electrons. Our analysis provides a detailed exploration of the influence of strong magnetic fields on neutrino emission, including both the modification of the total emission rate and the emergence of emission asymmetry relative to the magnetic field direction. We further examine the role of temperature in smoothing the oscillatory behavior of neutrino emission as a function of magnetic field strength. Additionally, we study the interplay between the Landau-level quantization of electrons and the Fermi-liquid effects of quarks in modifying the phase space of relevant weak processes. Finally, we briefly discuss the broader implications of magnetic fields on stellar cooling processes and the potential contribution of asymmetric neutrino emission to pulsar kicks."

To explicitize, we work on a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at $\\theta=\\pi$ in the mean field approximation, including the electromagnetic-scale anomaly term. We find that the thermal CP phase transition becomes first order and the strength of the first order gets more prominent as the magnetic field increases. The associated potential barrier is thermally created by the electromagnetic scale anomaly and gives rise to criticality due to the induced potential of a non-perturbative form $\\sim \\frac{|eB|^3}{f_\\pi} \\frac{|P|}{P^2 + m_0^2}$, where $eB$ denotes the magnetic field strength; $P$ the CP order parameter, and $m_0$ the isospin-symmetric current-quark mass."

      "summary": "arXiv:2502.14836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Self-consistent, multidimensional core-collapse supernova (SN) simulations, especially in 3D, have achieved tremendous progress over the past 10 years. They are now able to follow the entire evolution from core collapse through bounce, neutrino-triggered shock revival, shock breakout at the stellar surface to the electromagnetic SN outburst and the subsequent SN remnant phase. Thus they provide general support for the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism by reproducing observed SN energies, neutron-star (NS) kicks, and diagnostically relevant radioactive isotope yields; they allow to predict neutrino and gravitational-wave signals for many seconds of proto-NS cooling; they confirm correlations between explosion and progenitor or remnant properties already expected from previous spherically symmetric (1D) and 2D models; and they carve out various scenarios for stellar-mass black-hole (BH) formation. Despite these successes it is currently unclear which stars explode or form BHs, because different modeling approaches disagree and suggest the possible importance of the 3D nature of the progenitors and of magnetic fields. The role of neutrino flavor conversion in SN cores still needs to be better understood, the nuclear equation of state including potential phase transitions implies major uncertainties, the SN 1987A neutrino measurements raise new puzzles, and tracing a possible correlation of NS spins and kicks requires still more refined SN simulations."

The original method of model parameters’ calculations from leptonic decays , using pseudoscalar density constant is proposed. The method is generalized in radiative decays and with the following anomalous magnetic moments calculation of constituent and quarks. It has been shown that the obtained parameters lead to the values of magnetic and quadrupole moment of meson which are comparable with other models as well as hadronic transition observables. A comparative analysis of the obtained values of and quark magnetic moments has been carried out. It has been found that the proposed model gives numerical evaluations which are comparable to other approaches and models."
