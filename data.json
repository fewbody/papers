Compared to microscopic-macroscopic methods used so far, this self-consistent approach provides a greater flexibility of nuclear shapes.\n  Our working hypothesis is that the shape evolution proceeds while the system is still mononuclear. The results show that a ternary fission valley emerges for intermediate elongations of the middle fragment, only when its mass is strongly constrained. This ternary mode is dynamically suppressed by the competition with the dominant binary decay channel. This suggests that a description based solely on quantum tunneling through the energy barrier is insufficient to evaluate its probability.\n  To quantify this suppression, we apply a simple Langevin-type model of overdamped motion with constant damping and temperature, supplemented by a basic estimate of quantum tunneling where relevant. Under assumptions expected to yield an upper bound, we find the probability of ternary fission per binary decay to be on the order of $10^{-8}-10^{-9}$ for $^{252}$Cf and $10^{-10}-10^{-11}$ for $^{236}$U."

      "summary": "arXiv:2506.22670v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In [PRC 110, 025201], the authors construct a model for nuclear matter which features a quarkyonic phase. A main feature in this model is that the nucleon occupation is strongly reduced at small momenta. Somewhat surprisingly, this result is supported by data for electron scattering from nuclear matter, where a reduction of the cross section consistent with suppression of nucleons with small momenta is seen. Since nuclear matter data are obtained by extrapolation of electron scattering data on increasingly heavier systems, this feature should manifest at least to some degree in heavy nuclei. To check if this is plausible we extend the approach of [PRC 110, 025201] to finite nuclei by considering the nuclear Wigner distribution. We use non-relativistic and relativistic independent particle models to determine the nuclear Wigner distribution, in addition to the local-density approximation (LDA). Phase-space distributions of quarks are obtained as a convolution of the Wigner distribution with a quark momentum distribution. We highlight some properties of the Wigner distribution in spherical systems, which can spoil the interpretation of the quark phase-space distribution as occupation numbers in the Fermi sea. On the other hand, we show that large systems behave essentially like infinite nuclear matter in their interior, and that LDA and full results are quantitatively similar for large A. We then compute the fraction of baryons that would be in a quarkyonic phase in the same sense as in [PRC 110, 025201] for a set of nuclei with mass $12 \\leq A \\leq 238$. We find that this fraction systematically tends to a constant at large $A$. It is hence plausible that the suppression seen in the nuclear matter data is a genuine feature, present in large finite nuclei. This result is counter-intuitive and we discuss possible electron scattering measurements that could rule out this model."

Utilizing the AMPT model in both default and string melting modes, we examine the dependence of $v_2$ on transverse momentum, collision centrality, and particle type. Furthermore, we present $v_2$ scaled by participant eccentricity, which indicates a similar level of collectivity across different centrality intervals in d+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = 200\\mathrm{~GeV}$ within the AMPT-SM model. Our results indicate that the early-stage partonic phase significantly influences $v_2$, as observed by variations in parton scattering cross-section, while the later stage hadronic rescattering shows minimal impact. Comparisons with STAR and PHENIX experimental data show that the AMPT model effectively captures the transverse momentum dependence of $v_2$, underlining the importance of parton scattering mechanisms and the need for careful interpretation of experimental results in asymmetric systems."

The extracted values of the scaling factor are found to provide satisfactory account of the experimental data in all the cases, except for $^{42-51}$\\rm Ca isotopes where the calculated values differ significantly from the measured values. In the case of \\rm Ca isotopes, however, we find that inclusion of the phase variation of the nucleon-nucleon (NN) scattering amplitude, which is the basic input of the Glauber model, is able to provide an alternative way to serve the purpose of (phenomenological) scaling, and one gets systematically quite a good agreement between theoretical predictions and experiment. Additionally, the present work for finding the scaling factor may find its place to (i) investigate the suitability of the calculated proton radii of the exotic nuclei, given in the literature, and (ii) provide the reliable estimate for the CCCSs of those isotopes of a given element whose calculated charge radii are known, but their experimental CCCSs are not available."

This First Part of the paper is devoted to description of the model, SCQM, and in the forthcoming Second Part we will apply the model to built the nuclear structure.

Recently, we have shown that the values of the effective axial-vector current coupling constants ($g_A^\\mathrm{eff}$) for the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ and the two-neutrino double-$\\beta$ decays are close. This striking result was obtained for the first time by including vertex corrections and two-body currents in these matrix elements. In this letter, we calculate the half-life for the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay ($T_{1/2}^{0\\nu}$) of $^{136}$Xe using this closeness and show the convergence of the half-life with respect to the variation of the method to determine $g_A^\\mathrm{eff}$. The closeness of the $g_A^\\mathrm{eff}$ of the two decay modes plays a decisive role in predicting $T_{1/2}^{0\\nu}$. The appropriate value of $g_A^\\mathrm{eff}$ depends on the calculation method, and $g_A^\\mathrm{eff}$ is close to one in our perturbation calculation."

Large sets of numerical results are processed and connected in a consistent manner, using two key quantities: the mass of the star's Carbon-Oxygen (CO) core at an advanced pre-collapse stage - which depends on binary evolution effects - and the compactness parameter, which is the main descriptor of the post-collapse neutrino emission. The method enables us to model the neutrino emission of a very diverse, binary-affected population of stars, which cannot unambiguously be mapped in detail by existing core collapse simulations. We find that including black hole-forming collapses enhances the DSNB by up to 50% at energies greater than 30-40 MeV. Binary evolution effects can change the total rate of collapses and generate a sub-population of high core mass stars that are stronger neutrino emitters. However, the net effect on the DSNB is moderate - up to a 15% increase in flux - due to the rarity of these super-massive cores and to the relatively modest dependence of the neutrino emission on the CO core mass. The methodology presented here is suitable for extensions and generalizations, and therefore it lays the foundation for modern treatments of the DSNB."

Furthermore, we compute both the real and imaginary parts of the static heavy-quark potential in the chirally imbalanced plasma and argue that quarkonium suppression is enhanced due to the combined effects of a reduced debye screening length and an increased decay width.

To begin, this work introduces a direct method to calculate a hierarchic series of projective $C$ measurements for the removal of any $AB$ Gaussian noise, circumventing divergences in prior protocols. Next, a multimode conic framework is developed for pursuing the maximum (Gaussian entanglement of assistance, GEOA) or minimum (Gaussian entanglement of formation, GEOF) pure entanglement that may be revealed or required between $AB$. Within this framework, a geometric necessary and sufficient entanglement condition emerges as a doubly-enclosed conic volume, defining a novel distance metric for conic optimization. Extremizing this distance for spacelike vacuum entanglement in the massless and massive free scalar fields yields (1) the highest known lower bound to GEOA, the first that remains asymptotically constant with increasing vacuum separation and (2) the lowest known upper bound to GEOF, the first that decays exponentially mirroring the mixed $AB$ negativity. Furthermore, combination of the above with a generalization of previous partially-transposed noise filtering techniques allows calculation of a single $C$ measurement that maximizes the purified $AB$ entanglement. Beyond expectation that these behaviors of spacelike GEOA and GEOF persist in interacting theories, the present measurement and optimization techniques are applicable to physical many-body Gaussian states beyond quantum fields."

In elementary collisions, like $e^+e^-$, $e^-p$, or $pp$, phenomenological approaches to hadronization have been developed based on vacuum-like dynamics that require the creation of quark-antiquark and/or diquark pairs during the hadronization process. In the 2000s, the idea was developed that in ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus (AA) collisions, which lead to the formation of a partonic medium with large (anti-)quark densities, hadronization can occur through the recombination of in-medium quarks, unlike the situation in $e^+e^-$, $e^-p$, and $pp$. We give an overview of the main features that characterize quark recombination and have enabled a description of several important experimental observables at both RHIC and LHC over the last two decades. We highlight some additional developments and open issues. We specifically discuss the impact of coalescence on the study of heavy-flavor hadronization, including recent developments showing signatures of (the onset of) quark coalescence even in $pp$ collisions at TeV energies. Furthermore, we highlight specific features of hadronization for quarkonium in AA collisions, where it has been possible to develop a dynamical kinetic approach that allows to extract more detailed information about the temperature dependence of the heavy-quark interaction in hot QCD matter."

We obtain a simple flux tube solution in a controlled approximation scheme, that we compare to the results of lattice simulations."

      "summary": "arXiv:2410.00570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We investigate a system of bosons in a two-dimensional harmonic trap. In the limit of strong attractive interactions, the bosons make a droplet insensitive to external confinement. For weak interactions, in contrast, the ground state is given by the harmonic trap. In this work, we conduct a variational study of the transition between these two limits. We find that this transition occurs abruptly at the critical interaction strength whose value is universal if scaled appropriately with the number of particles. To connect the abrupt change in the properties of the system to the classical description of phase transitions, we analyze the static response of the Bose gas related to the isothermal compressibility. Finally, we perform numerically exact calculations for a few particles to demonstrate the effects of finite range interactions on this transition. We conclude that finite range effects wash out the point of transition."

      "summary": "arXiv:2502.15889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We calculate the perturbative corrections in the strong coupling to the unpolarized quark transverse-momentum dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) operator within a background-field framework, extending the approach of Ref. [1]. We focus on ensuring gauge invariance, identifying two key components needed: a gauge-invariant TMDPDF operator with a transverse gauge link at spatial infinity, and accounting of the equations of motion (EoM) of the background fields. We go beyond next-to-leading order in strong coupling expansion, considering multiple interactions with the background field at all orders of strong coupling. By examining the interplay between quark and gluon contributions, we show that spurious singularities, proportional to EoM, can be misinterpreted as genuine divergences in QCD factorization unless properly identified and removed."

      "summary": "The present paper shows a simple method to obtain fittings for the surface and curvature tensions. The method uses the nuclear mass of a spherical, fully ionized atom and a simple expression for the binding energy such that a least square fit is found when confronted with the atomic mass evaluation 2020. The fittings are then used to evaluate the pasta phase free energy per particle, which is confronted with the one obtained with a Thomas–Fermi fitting. The results are very encouraging and suggest that this recipe can be safely used whenever the surface and curvature tensions are necessary."

      "summary": "The flux of atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos measured in ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrino detectors is strongly dependent on the description of the propagation and absorption of the neutrinos during the passage through Earth to the detector. In particular, the attenuation of the incident neutrino flux depends on the details of the matter structure between the source and the detector. In this paper, we will investigate the impact of different descriptions for the density profile of Earth on the transmission coefficient, defined as the ratio between the flux measured in the detector and the incoming neutrino flux. We will consider five different models for the Earth’s density profile and estimate how these different models modify the target column density and transmission coefficients for different flavors. The results are derived by solving the cascade equations taking into account the neutral current interactions and tau regeneration. A comparison with approximated solutions is also presented. Our results indicated that the predictions are sensitive to the model considered for the density profile, with the simplified three layer model providing a satisfactory description when compared with the Preliminary Reference Earth Model results. Our results also showed that the more simplified models with two or one layer fail mainly for neutrinos that cross a small column of matter and are not good approximations for the neutrino propagation. These findings highlight the importance of using realistic Earth density models in UHE neutrino analyses, as simplified models may lead to misestimations in the predicted attenuation effects."

      "summary": "Observations of collective signatures within jets of particles have been recently reported by measurements at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN laboratory, providing insights on the minimum conditions required for forming a Quark Gluon Plasma state. A quantitative comparison with data measurements on intrajet azimuthal anisotropies and predictions from PYTHIA event generator soft quantum chromodynamics (QCD) model parameter tunes: Monash, CP5, and QCD-scheme colour reconnection (CR) is presented. Energetic jets with transverse momentum over 550 GeV from proton–proton collisions at 13 TeV are reconstructed. Results from predictions using the standard E-scheme (ES) and jet axis choice are compared with those from the winner-take-all (WTA) frame. Significant differences are present between predictions from WTA and ES frames at the lowest and highest intrajet charged particles multiplicities ( ), with the QCD-scheme CR tune showing the smallest variation between frames. Predictions for v2 at the highest are consistent with the data measurements at a 2.3σ uncertainty level. These results set new guidance towards the search for intrajet collective effects and understanding of nonperturbative QCD dynamics originated from a single parton."
