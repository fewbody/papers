      "summary": "This study demonstrates the application of supervised machine learning (ML) techniques to distinguish between isotropic and jet-like event topologies in heavy-ion collisions via the spherocity observable. State-of-the-art ML algorithms, optimized through systematic hyperparameter tuning, are employed to predict both the traditional transverse spherocity S0 and the unweighted transverse spherocity directly from raw event data. Moreover, the results of this study demonstrate that our approach remains largely model-independent, underscoring its potential applicability in future experimental heavy-ion physics analyses."
