Many model calculations show that the transition is first-order at sufficiently high baryon chemical potential. It is then natural to expect the existence of a critical point where the crossover and first-order phase transition lines meet. We show how to embed a phase boundary that terminates at the critical point in a smooth background equation of state, using several different but closely related criteria, so as to yield the critical exponents and critical amplitude ratios expected of a transition in the 3D Ising and liquid-gas universality class. The crossover curves can be tuned to pass through experimental freeze-out data from heavy ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC. The resulting equations of state can be used in hydrodynamic simulations of these collisions to probe the existence of a critical point and corresponding first-order phase transition."

Our method, which extends the finite-nucleon-number technique of arXiv:2211.07986 to the case of isospin-asymmetric matter, allows to study the impact of external isoscalar and isovector fields on the system. In particular, the densities and static response functions in the different isospin channels, and as a function of isospin asymmetry, are evaluated. Finite-size effects are discussed by comparing with Random Phase Approximation predictions in the thermodynamic limit. A peculiar non-monotonic behavior of the isovector response function is analyzed."

By incorporating key nuclear structural features-including mass number, proton-to-neutron ratio, magic number proximity, and angular momentum transfer-the optimized model captures essential physical mechanisms governing $\\alpha$-decay. On the test set, the model achieves significantly lower mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) compared to empirical models such as Royer and Budaca, particularly in the low-energy region. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis confirms these mechanisms are dominated by decay energy, angular momentum barriers, and shell effects. This work establishes a physically consistent, data-driven tool for nuclear property prediction and offers valuable insights into $\\alpha$-decay processes from a machine learning perspective."

We show that this parameter space is highly constrained and particularly sensitive to the equation of state and second-order transport coefficients. Through numerical analysis of the characteristic equations, we identify regions of strong hyperbolicity, weak hyperbolicity, and non-hyperbolicity, mapping the boundaries of causality violation as functions of the heat flux to energy density ratio $q/\\varepsilon$ and relaxation parameters. We also explore the causality conditions using a realistic lattice QCD-based equation of state. Using the Navier-Stokes approximation, we estimate the heat flow magnitude to assess causality criteria for one-dimensional heat conduction in heavy-ion collisions. Our calculations reveal unrealistically large heat flux values ($|{\\bf{q}}|/\\varepsilon \\sim 330-811$) for typical RHIC conditions when using thermal conductivity estimates from kinetic theory models, suggesting either significant overestimation of transport coefficients or breakdown of the fluid approximation in these extreme conditions. The pressure gradient corrections reduce the heat flow by approximately 15\\% but do not resolve the causality concerns."

      "summary": "arXiv:2508.03575v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Single-$\\Lambda$ hypernuclei are the most straightforward extension of atomic nuclei. A thorough description of baryonic system beyond first-generation quark sector is indispensable for the maturation of nuclear $ab$ $initio$ methods. This study pioneers the application of neural-network quantum states to hypernuclei, with trainable parameters determined by variational Monte Carlo approach (VMC-NQS). In order to reduce the numerical uncertainty and treat the nucleons and hyperons in a unified manner, spinor grouping (SG) method is proposed to analytically integrate out isospin degrees of freedom. A novel spin purification scheme is developed to address the severe spin contamination occurring in standard energy minimization due to the weakly bound characteristic of light single-$\\Lambda$ hypernuclei. The energy spectrum of $s$-shell hypernuclei is computed with one-thousandth level accuracy and benchmarked against existing stochastic variational results, showing superior performance. By comparing two different sets of Hamiltonian based on pionless effective field theory (pionless EFT), we choose an optimal model and further carry out calculations of selected $p$-shell charge-symmetric hypernuclei with mass number up to 13, exhibiting satisfactory consistency with experimental results. Our findings underscore the potential of VMC-NQS family in approaching exact solution of few-body systems and the accuracy of pionless EFT in modeling hypernuclei. This is crucial for understanding hyperon-nucleon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon-nucleon interactions, providing a powerful tool for precisely predicting the properties of multi-strangeness hypernuclei."

The theory is renormalized by the addition of counterterms. Necessary counterterms are determined by computing matrix elements of the effective Hamiltonian. All calculations are performed up to the second order in the expansion in powers of the coupling constant. Renormalized effective Hamiltonians are well-defined symmetric operators acting in the Fock space as opposed to the renormalized bare Hamiltonian, which is not well-defined without regularization. We introduce computational techniques that should streamline higher-order calculations and may be of independent interest."

In three-color QCD at finite density, especially at low temperatures, the notorious sign problem makes lattice Monte Carlo simulations intractable. In contrast, QC$_2$D is free from this issue due to the pseudoreality of the quark representation. Recent independent lattice studies have revealed unexpected phenomena through first-principles calculations of the phase structure and thermodynamics. A particularly notable finding is that the sound velocity exceeds the so-called conformal (holography) bound, \\( c_s^2/c^2 \\le 1/3 \\), which had not been observed in QCD-like theories at finite temperature. In this review, we focus primarily on results from a series of works by our group~\\cite{Iida:2019rah, Iida:2020emi,Iida:2022hyy, Ishiguro:2021yxr, Iida:2024irv}, along with related studies in dense QC$_2$D and three-color QCD with isospin chemical potential.

Using \\texttt{PYTHIA8} (v8.311) under ALICE/ATLAS kinematics, we analyze: extensive: FB multiplicity ($b_{\\rm corr}^{\\rm mult}$) and summed $p_{\\rm T}$ ($b_{\\rm corr}^{\\sum p_{\\rm T}}$) correlations; intensive: FB mean $p_{\\rm T}$ ($b_{\\rm corr}^{\\overline p_{\\rm T}}$) correlations; and \\textit{strongly intensive:} $\\Sigma_{\\rm N_F N_B}$ quantity in symmetric pseudorapidity intervals, validated against available experimental data. Systematic studies of $b_{\\rm corr}^{\\rm mult}$ as functions of $\\eta_{\\rm gap}$, $\\eta_{\\rm sep}$, and $\\eta$-$\\varphi$ sectors show MPI-based CR (ranges 3.6, 5.4) and QCD Color Rope significantly improve agreement with data. ISR/FSR critically influence $b_{\\rm corr}^{\\rm mult}$ and $b_{\\rm corr}^{\\sum p_{\\rm T}}$, with ISR dominant than FSR. Disabling ISR/FSR fails to replicate $\\eta_{\\rm gap}$-dependent trends. Further, $b_{\\rm corr}^{\\sum p_{\\rm T}}$ shows minimal CR-range sensitivity but the correlation strength increases when CR is disabled. Intensive quantity, $b_{\\rm corr}^{\\overline p_{\\rm T}}$, exhibit the opposite behavior to extensive observables i.e. the magnitude of $b_{\\rm corr}^{\\overline p_{\\rm T}}$ increases with the increase of CR strength, highlighting the distinct influence of CR on intensive versus extensive observables. Its azimuthal dependence indicates that parton showers drive short-range correlations. The analysis of the strongly intensive quantity as a function of pseudorapidity gap indicates that FSR plays a dominant role at larger gaps, in contrast to the behavior observed in FB multiplicity correlations."

We calculate the hyperon spin correlations within the same model, taking into account hydrodynamic effects and a $\\phi$ field fluctuating in space-time according to a Gaussian distribution. The $\\Lambda\\bar\\Lambda$ spin correlation induced by the $\\phi$ field is shown to be negative as opposed to that of $\\Lambda\\Lambda$ or $\\bar{\\Lambda}\\bar{\\Lambda}$. We thus propose a new net spin correlation as a sensitive probe to separate strong force effects from hydrodynamic ones. With the strength of the field fluctuations extracted from the observed $\\phi$ spin alignment, we predict the collision energy dependence of the hyperon spin correlations and also investigate the dependence of net spin correlation on azimuthal-angle and rapidity difference."

We demonstrate that the fluctuations of net-proton number do not reflect the total net-baryon number fluctuations in the vicinity of the nuclear liquid-gas phase transition. We also study the behavior of the baryon and proton number factorial cumulants. We highlight the importance of the non-trivial correlations between protons and neutrons."

The shell gaps are discussed from the excitation energies of the first $2^+$ states and the evolution of effective single-particle energies. We addressed different components of the nuclear interaction--central, spin-orbit, and tensor--and their roles in the development of shell gaps far from stability. The calculated results align well with the available experimental data and suggest a strengthening of the $N=34$ subshell gap and a weakening of the $N=32$ subshell gap below Ca. Additionally, the low-energy structures of the exotic $N=32$ isotones below Ca revealed that their ground states exhibit large deformation and coexist with a weakly deformed band at low excitation energy. The present work demonstrates essential components of the nuclear force in shaping magic numbers far from stability and provides deeper insights into the structure of exotic nuclei from the underlying nuclear forces."

We show that the factorization formula for $e^+e^-\\to (h_1\\cdots h_n)\\, X$ in Ref.~\\cite{Rogers:2024nhb} is equivalent to a version one can derive using the definition of a $n$-hadron fragmentation function (FF) introduced in Ref.~\\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx}. In addition, we scrutinize how to generalize the number density definition of a single-hadron FF to a $n$-hadron FF, arguing that the definition given in Ref.~\\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx} should be considered the standard one. We also emphasize that the evolution equations for dihadron FFs~(DiFFs) in Ref.~\\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx} have the same splitting functions as those for single-hadron FFs. Therefore, the DiFF (and $n$-hadron FF) definitions in Ref.~\\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx} have a natural number density interpretation and are consistent with collinear factorization using the standard hard factors and evolution kernels. Moreover, we make clear that the operator definition for the DiFF $D_1^{h_1h_2}(\\xi,M_h)$ written down in Ref.~\\cite{Rogers:2024nhb} agrees exactly with the one in Ref.~\\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx}.

Using a theoretical model for the electric current density in a force-free pulsar magnetosphere, we compute from first principles the distribution of electric current over the polar cap associated with an off-center magnetic dipole. We then use a simple prescription to compute the resulting temperature distribution, which allows us to derive the observed X-ray light curve. We investigate the role of the volumetric return current region in the polar cap and find that although it does not make a big difference in an aligned dipole case, the difference can be bigger in the case of an off-center dipole. Finally, we apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting to the X-ray light curves of pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0437--4715 with and without the volumetric return current, and find that our model can reasonably recover the observed X-ray light curves."
