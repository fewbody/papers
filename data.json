      "summary": "arXiv:2504.13410v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: An analytical formula with high accuracy is proposed for a systematic description of the capture cross sections from light to superheavy reaction systems. Based on the empirical barrier distribution (EBD) method, three key input quantities are refined by introducing the Coulomb exchange term to the Coulomb parameter $z$ for calculating the barrier height, incorporating the $Q$-value into the barrier distribution width calculations, and considering the surface effects of light nuclei and the deep inelastic scattering effects of superheavy systems on the barrier radius. These refinements substantially improve the model accuracy, not only the accuracy of the barrier height but also the accruacy of the capture cross sections at energies around the Coulomb barrier. The mean value of the deviations (in logarithmic scale) between the predicted cross sections and the data for a total of 426 reaction systems with $ 35 < Z_1 Z_2 < 2600$ is sharply reduced from 3.485 to 0.166."

The available data of the charge radius are reproduced with a root-mean-square deviation $\\sigma=0.033$ fm. In particular, for the nuclei between the closed shells, the descriptions of the charge radii are remarkably improved by including the deformation. Taking molybdenum isotopes as examples, both the evolutions of the charge radius and deformation are well reproduced. It is found that while the charge radius typically increases with the deformation, there also exist different cases. For example, in $^{346}$Sg, the charge radius of the deformed ground state is smaller than the one of the spherical state, and the largest binding energy does not necessarily correspond to the smallest charge radius."

This presentation is a digest of the first quantitative exploration of corrections to this picture when pions are included [1] (see there for a more comprehensive list of references). Since the pion mass and decay constant introduce dimensionful scales in the NN system, they explicitly break the symmetries of the Unitarity fixed point. In $\\chi$EFT, these symmetries must therefore be classified as emergent. This text focuses on the $\\chi$EFT variant with Perturbative (\"KSW\") Pions at next-to-next-to leading order (N2LO). This leads to the Hypothesis that both scale invariance and Wigner-SU(4) symmetry in the Unitarity Expansion show persistence, i.e. the footprint of both combined dominates even for $k\\gtrsim m_\\pi$ and is more relevant than chiral symmetry, so that the tensor/Wigner-SU(4) symmetry-breaking part of OPE is suppressed and does not enter before N3LO. Included are also ideas about underlying mechanisms and LO results of $\\chi$EFT with Nonperturbative Pions in the expansion about Unitarity."

In the metal-poor stars, the abundance of $^{22}$Ne is limited by the metallicity, so that the contribution of $^{22}$Ne($\\alpha$, n)$^{25}$Mg reaction on the s-process is small. Conversely, the $^{17}$O($\\alpha$, n)$^{20}$Ne reaction is more evident in more metal-poor stars due to the most abundant $^{16}$O in all metallicities. In this work, we calculate the evolution of four metal-poor models ($Z=10^{-3}$) for the Zero-Age Main-Sequence (ZAMS) masses of $M ({\\rm ZAMS})=$ 15, 20, 25, and 30 M$_{\\odot}$ to investigate the effect of reaction rates on the ws-process. We adopt the new $^{17}$O($\\alpha$, n)$^{20}$Ne and $^{17}$O($\\alpha, \\gamma$)$^{21}$Ne reaction rates suggested by Wiescher et al. (2023) and $^{22}$Ne($\\alpha$, n)$^{25}$Mg and $^{22}$Ne($\\alpha, \\gamma$)$^{26}$Mg from Best et al. (2013). The yields of the s-process isotope with updated reaction rates are compared with the results using default reaction rates from JINA REACLIB. We find that the effects of new $^{17}$O+$\\alpha$ are much more significant than those of new $^{22}$Ne+$\\alpha$ reaction rates in the non-rotation stars."

The phenomenological $\\Lambda N$ CSB interaction is introduced and the strength parameter is fitted to reproduce the experimental binding energy difference between the mirror hypernuclei $^{12}_\\Lambda$B and $^{12}_\\Lambda$C. This model is applied to calculate the CSB energy anomaly in mirror hypernuclei with the mass $A=7\\sim48$. The model is further applied to predict the binding energy difference of mirror hypernuclei of $A$=40 with the isospin $T=1/2$, $3/2$ and $5/2$ nuclei together with various hyper Ca isotopes and their mirror hypernuclei. Finally the binding energy systematics of $A=$48 hypernuclei are predicted with/without the CSB effect by the PK1 and TM2 energy density functionals (EDFs)."

      "summary": "arXiv:2411.03781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: In a unified perturbative treatment from the high-density side, we compute the speed of sound and the trace anomaly as functions of the chemical potential $\\mu$ for the two-color diquark superfluid, the pion-condensed high-isospin matter, and the 2SC quark matter. We find that the corrections induced by the gap energy $\\Delta$ involve nontrivial interplay between the dimensionless magnitude $|\\Delta/\\mu|$ and the derivative $|\\partial\\Delta/\\partial\\mu|$. Even though the gap equation has a common structure for these phases of our interest, different numerical constants cause drastic changes in the speed of sound corrections. As long as $|\\Delta/\\mu|$ is dominant over the derivative, the gap effects increase the speed of sound, which is consistent with the expected behavior of exhibiting a peak at intermediate density. We then discuss the trace anomaly which is pushed down generally by the gap effects and turns out to be negative widely in the high density regime. For demonstration of non-perturbative enhancement, we take account of the instanton-induced interaction. We confirm a further increase in the speed of sound for the two-color diquark superfluid and the pion-condensed high-isospin matter, while the speed of sound for the 2SC quark matter deviates far below the conformal limit due to the derivative contribution."

      "summary": "Inspired by the discrepancies observed in the b → sℓ+ℓ− neutral current decays, we study the decay channel (ℓ = μ, τ), which is based on the same flavor changing neutral current transition at the quark level. The current study shows that this decay channel can provide a useful probe for physics beyond the standard model. We use the helicity formalism while employing the effective theory approach where we include the effects of vector and axial vector ‘new’ physics (NP) operators. In this study, we have computed the branching ratio , the helicity fraction fL, the lepton forward–backward asymmetry , and the lepton flavor universality ratio (LFU) . In addition, as a complementary check on the LFU, we also calculate the various other LFU observables, where i = AFB, fL. We assume that the NP universal coupling is present for both muons and tauons, while the non-universal coupling is only present for muons. Regarding these couplings, we employ the latest global fit to the b → sℓ+ℓ− data, which is recently computed in Algueró etal [Eur. Phys. J. C83 648 (2023)]. We give predictions of some of the mentioned observables within the SM and the various NP scenarios. We have found that not only are the considered observables sensitive to NP but are also helpful in distinguishing among the different NP scenarios. These results can be tested at the LHCb, HL-LHC, and FCC-ee, and therefore, a precise measurements of these observables not only deepens our understanding of the b → sℓ+ℓ− process but also provides a window of opportunity to possibly study various NP scenarios."

      "summary": "Lattice QCD calculations of the 2s radial excitation of the nucleon place the state at an energy of approximately 1.9 GeV, raising the possibility that it is associated with the N1/2+(1880) and N1/2+(1710) resonances through mixing with two-particle meson-baryon states. The discovery of the N1/2+(1880) resonance in pion photoproduction but not in πN scattering and the small width of the N1/2+(1710) resonance suggest that a state associated with these resonances would be insensitive to the manner in which pions are permitted to dress it. To explore this possibility, we examine the spectrum of nucleon radial excitations in both 2 + 1 flavour QCD and in simulations where the coupling to meson-baryon states is significantly modified through quenching. We find the energy of the 2s radial excitation to be insensitive to this modification for quark masses close to the physical point. This invariance provides further evidence that the 2s radial excitation of the nucleon is associated with the N1/2+(1880) and N1/2+(1710) resonances."
