      "summary": "arXiv:2505.00828v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The development of systematic effective field theories (EFTs) for nuclear forces and advances in solving the nuclear many-body problem have greatly improved our understanding of dense nuclear matter and the structure of finite nuclei. For global nuclear calculations, density functional theories (DFTs) have been developed to reduce the complexity and computational cost required in describing nuclear systems. However, DFT often makes approximations and assumptions about terms included in the functional, which may introduce systematic uncertainties compared to microscopic calculations using EFTs. In this work, we investigate possible avenues of improving nuclear DFT using nonlinear relativistic mean-field (RMF) theory. We explore the impact of RMF model extensions by fitting the nonlinear RMF model to predictions of nuclear matter and selected closed-shell nuclei using four successful chiral EFT Hamiltonians. We find that these model extensions are impactful and important in capturing the physics present within chiral Hamiltonians, particularly for charge radii and neutron skins of closed-shell nuclei. However, there are additional effects that are not captured within the RMF model, particularly within the isoscalar sector of RMF theory. Additional model extensions and the reliability of the nonlinear RMF model are discussed."

To enable direct comparison between two approaches, we designed the uniform likelihood function with a Gaussian-equivalent normalization factor and marginalization behavior. Across three representative astrophysical scenarios, both approaches yield nearly identical mass-radius relations, density-pressure relations, and overlapping 95.4\\% confidence level regions. We find significant variations in the predicted distributions of nuclear characteristics at nuclear saturation in the isoscalar channel, e.g., in nuclear compressibility $K_{\\rm sat}$, whereas the isovector quantities, for example, proton fraction, are quite similar. Our results indicate that the influence of individual nuclear characteristics at saturation density on the global properties of compact stars is obscured by the integral nature of these quantities. This, in turn, underscores the need for dedicated nuclear experiments sensitive to these characteristics in order to better constrain their values."

These rates play a crucial role in the gravitational collapse of the core of a massive star activating the supernova explosion. As per simulation results, capture rates on chromium isotopes have a major impact on controlling the lepton-to-baryon fraction of the stellar core during the late phases of evolution of massive stars. In this paper we calculate the electron capture rates on isotopes of chromium with mass range $42\\leq A \\leq 65$, including neutron-deficient and neutron-rich isotopes. For the calculation of weak rates in stellar matter, we used the pn-QRPA model with separable Gamow-Teller forces and took deformation of nucleus into consideration. A recent study proved this form of pn-QRPA to be the best for calculation of GT strength distributions amongst the pn-QRPA models. The stellar weak rates are calculated over a broad range of temperature $(0.01 \\times 10^{9}-30 \\times 10^{9} (K))$ and density $(10-10^{11}(g/cm^{3}))$ domain. We compare our electron capture rates with the pioneering calculation of Fuller, Fowler, and Newman (FFN) and with the large-scale shell model (LSSM) calculation.

The purpose of this work is two fold, one is to improve the earlier calculation of weak rates performed by \\citep{Nabi99} using the same theory. We further compare our results with previous calculations. The selected $sd$-shell nuclei, considered in this work, are of special interest for the evolution of O-Ne-Mg core in 8-10 M$_\\odot$ stars due to competitive gamma ray heating rates and cooling by URCA processes. The outcome of these competitions is to determine, whether the stars end up as a white dwarf \\citep{Nabi08}, an electron-capture supernova \\citep{Jones13} or Fe core-collapse supernova \\citep{Suz16}. The selected $sd$-shell nuclei for calculation of associated weak-interaction rates include $^{20,23}$O, $^{20,23}$F, $^{20,23,24}$Ne, $^{20,23-25}$Na, and $^{23-25}$Mg.

The calculated gamma heating rates are orders of magnitude bigger than the shell model rates (except for $^{25}$Mg at low densities). At high temperatures the gamma heating rates are in reasonable agreement. The calculated cooling rates are up to an order of magnitude bigger for odd-A nuclei."

The Gogny-type density functional, which is equivalent to the mean-field calculations with finite-range density-dependent effective interactions, is a successful example. In contrast, the shell-model (configuration-interaction) calculation is a powerful tool to describe nuclear structure, especially spectroscopic properties.

The isospin symmetry is primarily violated by the electromagnetic interactions, namely the Coulomb interaction among protons, effects of which need be studied to understand importance of the isospin symmetry. We investigate the effect of the Coulomb interaction on nuclear properties, especially the quadrupole deformation and neutron drip line, utilizing the density functional method which provides a universal description of nuclear systems in the entire nuclear chart. We carry out calculations of even-even nuclei with the proton number 2 to 60. The results show that the Coulomb interaction plays a significant role in enhancing the quadrupole deformation across a wide range of nuclei. We also find that nuclei near the neutron drip line gain an additional binding energy by the Coulomb interaction, which may lead to a shift of the neutron drip line toward a larger neutron number."

      "summary": "arXiv:2505.01294v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Measurements of fission fragment mass distributions provide valuable insights into the properties of fissioning systems and the dynamics of the fission process. Pre-neutron emission distributions, essential for fission fragment evaporation codes like \\cgmf{}, are extracted from distributions that are always measured after neutron emission, as the time scale of the emission of prompt fission neutrons is too short for direct measurement before the emission. However, obtaining accurate pre-neutron emission distributions requires methods that eliminate the effects of mass resolution and detector efficiency. We propose a deblurring technique based on the Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm, commonly used in optics for image restoration, to correct for these experimental effects. The RL algorithm uses the measured mass distributions and a transfer matrix to perform iterative deconvolution. The advantage of this method over others is that it does not assume any predefined shape such as a sum of Gaussians, as in \\cgmf{}, for the distributions. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the fission fragment mass distributions measured in the spontaneous fission of $^{252}$Cf to extract pre-neutron emission fission fragment mass distributions. The results from deblurring are then used as inputs to \\cgmf{}, and we compare the \\cgmf{} results obtained using deblurring inputs with the default \\cgmf{} results."

The prediction of the cross-section is obtained through $SU(3)$ chiral perturbation theory up to the next-to-leading order, which is smaller than the experimental data in the energy region [0.6-0.65] GeV, though the data has only a few points and poor statistics. Then, the resonance chiral theory is applied to include the resonance contribution, with the lightest scalars and vectors written in the effective Lagrangians. A series of relevant decay widths and the masses of the vectors are studied to fix the unknown couplings. The resonance contribution should be one order larger than that of the chiral perturbation theory but still one to two orders smaller than the data.The significant discrepancy urged the new experimental measurements to give more guidance.We also compute the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution from the four pion channels to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $(g-2)_\\mu$.

These two calculations should apply sequentially in the description of the energy loss of a heavy quark that starts out ultrarelativistic, loses energy, slows down, becomes non-relativistic at later times, and ultimately comes to rest and diffuses in the strongly coupled plasma. We provide an ansatz for uniquely incorporating both regimes to give an approximate but unified description of how a heavy quark that is initially ultrarelativistic loses energy all the way until it comes to rest. We implement this ansatz in the Hybrid Strong/Weak Coupling Model. With this new, consistent, treatment of heavy quark energy loss at strong coupling, we confront our predictions for the suppression and azimuthal anisotropies of D- and B-mesons, as well as B-tagged jets, with available experimental data."

Current measurements at RHIC and the LHC observe a significant suppression in the per-trigger yield at forward rapidities compared to that in proton-proton collisions, nominally consistent with the \"mono-jet\" production expected in a saturation scenario. However, the width of the azimuthal correlation remains unmodified, in contradiction to the qualitative expectations from this physics picture. I investigate whether the construction of these observables leaves them sensitive to effects from simple nuclear shadowing as captured by, for example, universal nuclear parton distribution function (nPDF) analyses. I find that modern nPDF sets, informed by recent precision measurements sensitive to the shadowing of low-$x_\\mathrm{A}$ gluon densities in LHC and other data, can describe all or the majority of the di-hadron/jet suppression effects in $p$+A data at both RHIC and the LHC, while giving a natural explanation for why the azimuthal correlation width is unmodified.

All three types of evolution become important when both $P_\\perp$ and $K_\\perp$ are much larger than the nuclear saturation momentum $Q_s(x)$ and we propose a framework which encompasses all of them.

Following the recently developed novel relaxation time approximation (RTA) model, we have proposed a novel Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK) model with a modified collision integral to carry out the aforementioned study. We have also compared our findings with the results of the novel RTA, the standard RTA and the standard BGK models. Our observation shows that the novel collision integrals for both the RTA and BGK models decrease the charge and the heat transport phenomena in the medium, as evidenced by the reduced values of the transport coefficients, such as the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity, when compared to the standard RTA and standard BGK models. Furthermore, certain observables associated with the abovementioned transport coefficients, such as the thermal diffusion constant and the Lorenz number have been explored using the novel approaches of the aforesaid models. We have found an overall decreasing trend of the thermal diffusion constant with the temperature in the novel BGK model, similar to the novel RTA model, but the magnitude remains higher throughout the temperature range. However, the magnitude of the thermal diffusion constant in the proposed novel BGK model remains conspicuously lower than its value in the standard BGK model. The magnitude of the Lorenz number in the novel BGK model remains significantly higher than that in the standard BGK model, but it is lower than that in the novel RTA model. We have also observed that the Lorenz number in all cases has an increasing trend at low temperatures, showing a violation of the Wiedemann–Franz law, whereas at high temperatures, it becomes saturated. The Lorenz number remaining above unity indicates that the thermal conductivity prevails over the electrical conductivity in the aforesaid models."
