Meißner, and Zhengxue RenWe present a systematic ab initio study of the low-lying states in beryllium isotopes from $^{7}\\mathrm{Be}$ to $^{12}\\mathrm{Be}$ using nuclear lattice effective field theory with the ${\\mathrm{N}}^{3}\\mathrm{LO}$ interaction. Our calculations achieve good agreement with experimental data for energ…[Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 162503] Published Fri Apr 25, 2025"
