The increase in computational power has naturally led to new applications of mean-field (and beyond) methods. This is particularly the case of quasi-fission reactions. Since the first edition, significant progress has also been made in treating pairing correlations dynamically, leading to realistic applications in multi-nucleon transfer, fusion and fission reactions. A new section has been added on fission dynamics. A summary of recent researches on nuclear dynamics with realistic microscopic quantum approaches is presented. The Balian-Veneroni variational principle is used to derive the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) equation describing the dynamics at the mean-field level, as well as an extension including small-amplitude quantum fluctuations which is equivalent to the time-dependent random-phase approximation (TDRPA). Such formalisms as well as their practical implementation in the nuclear physics framework with modern three-dimensional codes are discussed. Recent applications to nuclear dynamics, from collective vibrations to heavy-ion collisions are presented. A particular attention is devoted to the interplay between collective motions and internal degrees of freedom. For instance, the harmonic nature of collective vibrations is questioned. Large amplitude collective motions are investigated in the framework of heavy-ion collisions and fission. How fusion is affected by the internal structure of the collision partners, such as their deformation, is discussed. Other mechanisms in competition with fusion, and responsible for the formation of fragments which differ from the entrance channel (transfer reactions, deep-inelastic collisions, and quasi-fission) are investigated. Finally, studies of actinide collisions forming, during very short times of few zeptoseconds, the heaviest nuclear systems available on Earth, are presented."

The $\\alpha n$ and $\\alpha\\alpha$ contact interactions are derived from cluster effective field theory. The two-body potentials defined in momentum space are regularized by a Gaussian cutoff. The associated low-energy constants are found by comparing the calculated low-energy T-matrix with its effective range expansion. A three-body state-dependent potential is also introduced in the model. First, the ${}^9$Be three-body binding energy is studied within the non-symmetrized hyperspherical harmonics method. Then, the low-energy cross section is calculated via the Lorentz integral transform method, focussing on the dominant electric dipole transitions. A twofold evaluation of the nuclear current matrix element is presented, employing both the electric dipole transition operator (Siegert theorem) and the one-body convection current operator. This approach is adopted to allow for a discussion of the effect of the many-body currents."

At high energies, the bound is compared with proton-proton scattering data; at low energies, with numerical bootstrap results obtained by directly maximizing the cross-section. We conjecture that the amplitude saturating the cross-section at high energies lies at a strongly-coupled corner of the allowed space of low-energy parameters. This universal amplitude exhibits a rising total cross-section, a shrinking elastic differential cross-section with multiple diffractive minima, and a surprisingly rich spectrum of resonances aligning along Regge trajectories, including Pomeron-like and daughter trajectories, as well as unusual ``singular\" trajectories in the forward limit which appear deeply interconnected with Froissart growth. Remarkably, the eikonal representation reveals that the scattering is localized within an annular region that slowly expands with energy, challenging the traditional ``disk\" diffraction picture. Our results open the door to theoretical and phenomenological studies of \\emph{soft} high-energy hadronic scattering via the S-matrix Bootstrap."

Here, we realize the same using a $2n$-dimensional string defect embedded in $(2n+2)$-dimensional spacetime on a finite lattice for $n=1$. This string is a lattice version of the continuum axion string described in Callan-Harvey. Our results are obtained in a Hamiltonian formulation in Minkowski spacetime.

In a prior work [Phys. Rev. D 106, 125012 (2022)], I had obtained a symmetric and gauge-invariant EMT by using Noether's second theorem instead, with local spacetime translations as the symmetry group. However, the derivation therein was flawed, containing a faulty assumption about the transformation rule for spinor fields. In this work, I revisit the derivation of [Phys. Rev. D 106, 125012 (2022)], both correcting the faulty step and simplifying the derivation for broader accessibility. The end result is an EMT for quantum chromodynamics that is gauge-invariant, but not symmetric."

The modeling is flexible, constrained by sparsely available experimental data, and satisfies theoretical requirements, including reduction to nucleon distribution amplitudes in the appropriate limit. We study the sensitivity of observable predictions to various modeling assumptions. We discuss unpolarized cross-sections, as well as the three non-vanishing polarization observables at leading twist, namely, the single transverse target spin asymmetry and the two double spin asymmetries that occur with a polarized lepton beam on either a longitudinally or transversely polarized target. The analysis is complemented by a simple Monte Carlo study to provide guidance for exploring exclusive processes in the so-called backward kinematics. Our work aims to highlight the importance of future measurements to better constrain TDAs and to support upcoming experimental proposals."

      "summary": "arXiv:2506.05025v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The strong force which binds hadrons is described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Determining the character and manifestations of QCD is one of the most important and challenging outstanding issues necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the structure of hadrons. Within the context of the QCD parton picture, the parton distribution functions (PDFs) have been remarkably successful in describing a wide variety of processes. However, these PDFs have generally been confined to the description of collinear partons within the hadron. New experiments and facilities provide the opportunity to additionally explore the three-dimensional structure of hadrons, which can be described by generalized parton distributions (GPDs), for example. In recent years, a breakthrough was made in calculating the Bjorken-$x$ dependence of PDFs in lattice QCD by using large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) and other similar frameworks. The breakthrough has led to the emergence and rapid development of direct calculations of Bjorken-$x$--dependent structure. In this review article, we show some of the recent progress made in lattice QCD in PDFs and GPDs and discuss future challenges."

The effective theory is based on the baryon sector dynamical spin-flavor $SU(4)$ symmetry emergent in the large $N_c$ limit, whose breaking in controlled by the $1/N_c$ expansion. The non-commutativity of the chiral and $1/N_c$ expansions in unitarity corrections (loops) requires a linking of both expansions. As it was shown in the case of baryon masses and currents, the natural linking is the $\\xi$-expansion, in which ${\\cal{O}}(p)={\\cal{O}}(1/N_c)={\\cal{O}}(\\xi)$. The spin-flavor symmetry requires that the ground state baryons span an $SU(4)$ symmetric irreducible representation which implies that in particular $N$ and $\\Delta$ are active degrees of freedom in the effective theory.\n  The scattering amplitude is expanded to the next-to-next to leading order in the $\\xi$ expansion, corresponding to the one-loop contributions with the LO Lagrangian. The results are given for generic $N_c$ in order to demonstrate the consistency of the framework. The spin-flavor symmetry plays a central role in maintaining the consistency of the effective theory with respect to the $1/N_c$ expansion. This consistency manifests itself in an improvement in the convergence of the low energy expansion with respect to the case of the ordinary BChPT without an explicit dynamical $\\Delta$, which is known to be inconsistent the constraints of $N_c$ scaling.\n  Fits to the $\\pi N\\to \\pi N$ S, P and D partial wave amplitudes from the SAID data base are finally used to test the framework and to determine the energy range of its applicability."

Our expansion can be used to describe neutron star mergers using the equation of state inferred from neutron star observations. We discuss how knowledge from low-energy nuclear experiments and heavy-ion collisions can be directly incorporated into the expansion. We also suggest new thermodynamic quantities of interest that can be calculated from theoretical models or directly inferred by experimental data that can be used to infer the finite temperature equation of state. With our new method, we can quantify the uncertainty in our finite $T$ and $Y_Q$ expansions without making assumptions about the underlying degrees of freedom. We can reproduce results from a microscopic equation of state up to $T=100$ MeV for baryon chemical potential $\\mu_B\\gtrsim 1100$ MeV ($\\sim1-2 \\ n_{\\rm sat}$) within $5\\%$ error, with even better results for larger $\\mu_B$ and/or lower $T$.

The motion of the spin is explicitly considered using the spin canonical variables derived by semiclassical approximation to the spin coherent state path integral representation. In addition to the diametric and two circular PO families with frozen spin, solutions that bridge two circular POs are found in which orbital motion is coupled to spin precession. In addition, each bridge encounters a secondary bifurcation on the way from one circular PO to the other and generates a new PO, that survives at higher energies while maintaining a constant period. The generic expressions for those POs are obtained explicitly, and all the above peculiar bifurcation scenarios are described fully analytically."

These states may also be influenced by new high-scale, weakly interacting physics. Incorporating right-handed neutrinos into an effective field theory framework -the νSMEFT- offers a systematic approach to study the phenomenology of heavy neutrinos in current and upcoming experiments. In this work, we present the first prospective 95% exclusion plots achievable at a future lepton collider operating at a center-of-mass energy of for what we term the agnostic νSMEFT scenario. This study focuses on the high-mass regime where the heavy neutrino N decays promptly into leptons and jets. Specifically, we analyse the processes e+e− → νN → νμ−μ+ν and e+e− → νN → νμ−jj, deriving the exclusion regions in the versus mN parameter space. When compared to prospective limits for the LHeC, we find that the semi-leptonic process with final jets in a lepton collider offers the greatest sensitivity, even with a straightforward cut-based analysis. The expected bounds are as stringent as those considered in recent studies for the low-mass regime where the N may be long-lived and detectable via displaced decay searches, both at the LHC and future colliders."
