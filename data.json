While most \\textit{ab initio} studies employ nonrelativistic Schr\\\"odinger-equation frameworks, this work offers a relativistic perspective. Using a leading-order (LO) relativistic chiral interaction, we describe two-nucleon scattering via the Thompson equation, symmetric nuclear matter, and medium-mass nuclei (Ca, Ni, Zr, Sn) via the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory. Systematic uncertainties from regulator cutoffs and interaction parameters are analyzed. The empirical saturation region of nuclear matter is reproduced, and the binding energies and charge radii of medium-mass nuclei agree reasonably well with experimental data, significantly improving the ``Coester line\". These results highlight that the relativistic approach, employing a leading-order chiral force with only four low-energy constants and no three-nucleon forces, can capture the most important dynamics and offer a complementary pathway to address longstanding challenges in nuclear \\textit{ab initio} studies."

Beyond-mean-field correlations, arising from symmetry restoration and shape mixing, are incorporated via the generator coordinate method with projection onto states with well-defined parity, particle number, and angular momentum. Our results reveal a correlation between the contributions of nuclear intermediate states to Schiff moments and the electric dipole transition strengths from these states to the ground state.

To this end, we use in-medium chiral perturbation theory to compute the relevant Feynman diagrams up to two-loop diagrams. Our results show that the isospin asymmetry of the nuclear matter splits these quantities into three separate values, corresponding to the three pions. Consequently, the tendency of each in-medium pion mass, wave function renormalization, and decay constant is dependent on the density and the neutron-to-proton ratio $\\rho_n/\\rho_p$ of nuclear matter.

Recently, various configurations of $^{16}$O from \\textit{ab initio} calculations were implemented in heavy-ion models, such as the hydrodynamic model and a multiphase transport model (AMPT) to study cluster effects in relativistic $^{16}$O +$^{16}$O collisions. However, divergent predictions across configurations and models complicate interpretations. In this Letter, we isolate the impact of multi-nucleon correlations in relativistic $^{16}$O +$^{16}$O collisions while fixing the one-body density distribution of $^{16}$O. Our results show that the normalized ratios ${\\rm Norm}(v_{2}\\{2\\}/v_{2}\\{4\\})$ and ${\\rm Norm}(v_{2}\\{2\\}/v_{3}\\{2\\})$ effectively probe the effects of one-body density (e.g., tetrahedral symmetry) and multi-nucleon correlations (e.g., $\\alpha$ clusters).

This approach combines well-established techniques, namely the Complex Scaling (CS) and Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG) methods while employing the translationally invariant No-Core Shell Model (NCSM) as a few-body solver. We demonstrate that this combination effectively overcomes numerical limitations previously encountered in exploring continuum properties of light nuclei with standard many-body techniques, and at the same time makes less imperative the need for a continuous set of basis states for the continuum. To benchmark the method for applications in the many-body sector, we apply it to the \\textsuperscript{4}He system, where semi-exact calculations within a finite basis are feasible. Our extrapolated results agree with exact calculations already published in the literature. We argue that different NN parametrizations of chiral EFT Hamiltonians will not permit to reproduce evaluated resonance properties of \\textsuperscript{4}He. As an application, we showcase the case of the tetraneutron. This work enables the application of the method to $A>4$-mass systems, providing a reliable representation of the initial Hamiltonian and its continuum properties."

Here we consider representing the gauge degrees of freedom in field basis in position space and develop a quantum algorithm for real-time simulation. We show that the Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian is equivalent to the temporal gauge Hamiltonian when acting on physical states consisting of fermion and transverse gauge fields. The Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian guarantees that the unphysical longitudinal gauge fields do not propagate and thus there is no need to impose any constraint. The local gauge field basis and the canonically conjugate variable basis are swapped efficiently using the quantum Fourier transform. We prove that the qubit cost to represent physical states and the gate depth for real-time simulation scale polynomially with the lattice size, energy, time, accuracy and Hamiltonian parameters. We focus on the lattice theory without discussing the continuum limit or the UV completion of QED."

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of high-${p_{T}}$ inclusive jets extending up to 1 TeV to probe the quark-gluon plasma medium at much shorter distance scales. It focuses on quenching effects observed in the quark-gluon plasma formed during Pb-Pb collisions at ${\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV, particularly for the most-central (0-10\\%) collisions. Jet-medium interactions represent a pivotal domain of both theoretical and experimental QGP studies, with various models offering different assumptions to describe these phenomena. To illustrate this modular approach, this work computes the nuclear modification factor for inclusive jets via coupling of the MATTER model (which simulates the high virtuality phase of the parton evolution) with the LBT model (which simulates the low virtuality phase of the parton evolution). Additionally, the two successful energy loss models: MARTINI and AdS/CFT are employed to characterize the jet-suppression effectively within the JETSCAPE framework. The results are compared with the experimental data from the ATLAS and CMS detectors, covering jet transverse momentum (${p_{T}}$) ranging from 100 GeV to 1 TeV for ATLAS and 300 GeV to 1 TeV for CMS. The predictions made by the JETSCAPE are consistent in the high ${p_{T}}$ range as well as for extreme jet cone sizes, showing deviation within 10-25\\%. Our major focus is on calculating the double ratio (${R^{\\mathrm{R}}_{\\mathrm{AA}}/R^{\\mathrm{R=small}}_{\\mathrm{AA}}}$) as a function of jet-R and jet-${p_{T}}$, where the experimental results align well with predictions from the JETSCAPE framework."

In particular, it has been employed in the search of fluctuations characteristic of the critical point (CP) of strongly interacting matter. However, intermittency analysis has been hindered by the fact that factorial moments measurements corresponding to different scales are correlated, since the same data are conventionally used to calculate them. This invalidates many assumptions involved in fitting data sets and determining the best fit values of power-law exponents. We present a novel approach to intermittency analysis, employing the well-established statistical and data science tool of Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

      "summary": "The ground state properties of finite, bulk matter, and neutron stars are investigated using a proposed effective interaction (HPU4) of the relativistic mean field model (RMF) that incorporates self and cross-couplings of σ, ω, and ρ mesons with nucleons. This interaction has been constructed by fitting data on binding energies and charge radii of finite nuclei, neutron skin ( ) of nucleus, and astrophysical observations of the maximum masses of neutron stars. ( ) = 0.146±0.019 fm is achieved with soft symmetry energy ( = 27.91±1.31 MeV) and its corresponding slope ( = 42.85±14.26 MeV) at saturation density. An equation of state (EoS) with a composition of β-equilibrated nucleonic and leptonic matter is computed. The nuclear matter and neutron star properties are also analyzed for this interaction and agree well with the astrophysical observations, such as the NICER and GW170817 events. We also perform a statistical analysis to estimate the theoretical errors in coupling parameters and neutron star observables and to determine the correlation coefficients. We observe that the neutron skins of and are strongly correlated and exhibit a strong dependence on , and the curvature of symmetry energy ( ) as suggested from their correlations. A strong correlation of canonical mass neutron star radius, with ρ-meson-nucleon coupling quantified by the term and mixed interaction terms and is also observed."

      "summary": "The distribution of nuclei produced in the 40Ar + 232Th reaction has been studied at the gas-filled recoil separator (SHANS2) at the China Accelerator Facility for Superheavy Elements (CAFE2). The bombardment was carried out at a beam energy of 205 MeV with the detection system installed at the focal plane. Forty-four isotopes heavier than 208Pb were observed. These isotopes were identified as the transfer reaction (or target-like) products, and their relative cross-sections were extracted. Based on the mass distribution of these products, we exclude the possibility that they were produced by fusion-fission reactions; thus, they may originate from quasi-fission of the 40Ar + 232Th reaction."

The experiment was carried out on the Van de Graaff accelerator EG–5 at the Frank Laboratory of Neutron Physics, Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. Fast neutrons were produced via the 2H(d,n)3He reaction with a deuterium gas target. A twin gridded ionization chamber was used as the charged particle detector, with back–to–back 148Sm samples mounted on tantalum backings at the common cathode. The absolute neutron flux was measured using the 238U3O8 sample. The obtained cross section data were compared with those from existing nuclear data libraries and theoretical calculations using the TALYS–1.96 code. The present results for the 148Sm(n,α)145Nd reaction are expected to resolve discrepancies among various nuclear evaluation data."

      "summary": "Shape competition and coexistence between the pear- and the tetrahedral-shape octupole deformations in actinide nuclei is investigated by employing the realistic nuclear mean-field theory with the phenomenological, so-called 'universal' Woods-Saxon Hamiltonian with newly adjusted parameters containing no parametric correlations. Both types of octupole deformations exhibit significant effects in , , and isotones. Nuclear potential energy calculations within the multi-dimensional deformation spaces reveal that the tetrahedral deformation effects generally lead to deeper energy minima in most nuclei with and . Interestingly, in the nuclei , , and , selected for the illustration of the studied effects, the influence of pear-shape octupole deformation is comparable to that of tetrahedral octupole deformation. Consequently, the coexistence of both kinds of octupole shapes is predicted by the potential energy calculations. In particular, we have reproduced the experimental results known for pear-shape rotational bands obtaining in this way an estimate of the quality of the modelling parametrisation. With the same Hamiltonian, we have predicted the properties of the tetrahedral symmetry rotational bands. To facilitate the possible experiment-theory cooperation we have derived the exact spin-parity tetrahedral-band structures by applying the standard methods of the group representation theory for the Td point-group."
