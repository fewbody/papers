      "summary": "Author(s): P. Aguilera et al.Atomic nuclei within an isobaric multiplet have rather similar structure, and studying β decay between these nuclei is a powerful spectroscopy tool. An international team of researchers reports on a large amount of nuclear structure data for several nuclei near the proton dripline: 64Se, its isobar multiplet neighbor 64As, and 63Ge. 64Se is the heaviest Tz=−2 nucleus that both β decays and has a stable mirror partner Tz=+2. The experiment used fragmentation from a high-intensity 78Kr beam at the RIKEN Nishina Center in Japan and recorded in addition to β-delayed γ rays also decay protons from states above the separation energy. The comprehensive spectroscopy led to new insights on the isobaric mass multiplet equation for the A=64 T=2 system, the heaviest multiplet where these studies are possible, and found good mirror symmetry. In also measuring the half-life of 64Se and revisiting the idea of the anti-analog state originally discussed for the A=56 system half a century ago, the work brings detailed nuclear decay studies very close to the proton drip line.[Phys.

      "summary": "arXiv:2511.14891v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In addition to signals for the critical point, evidence for a first order phase transition would indicate a nontrivial structure within the QCD phase diagram. Moreover, while not a direct measurement of the critical point, the presence of a first order transition would imply its existence. This motivates the need to understand signatures of this first order transition in addition to directly studying the effect of a critical point. To this effect, we map the mean-field Ising model equation of state onto the QCD phase diagram, and reconstruct the full coexistence region in the case of a first order phase transition. Beyond the coexistence line, we maintain access to the spinodal region in the phase diagram, thus providing a description of metastable and unstable phases of matter. Thus, we describe the super-heated hadronic phase and the super-cooled quark-gluon plasma, which is useful for hydrodynamic simulations of the fireball created in a heavy-ion collision at low collision energy, where a first order phase transition is expected. We discuss the features of the pressure and other thermodynamic observables as functions of temperature and baryonic chemical potential, in particular their behavior in the coexistence region. Finally, we compare our equation of state to 3D Ising model ones available in the literature."

      "summary": "arXiv:2511.15040v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present a systematic survey of even-even nuclei with $Z>50$ to identify where a very large prolate configuration driven by the second intruder orbit emerges. Within the energy density functional theory framework, we find in representative cases a pronounced prolate minimum at quadrupole deformation $\\beta_2\\approx$ 0.3--0.4. A characteristic feature of these minima is a local enhancement of the hexadecapole ($\\beta_4$) component relative to nearby deformations, which is a clear fingerprint of the $\\beta_2$--$\\beta_4$ coupling expected for the second intruder orbit. Representative comparisons among three Skyrme interactions show a similar appearance of the highly deformed minimum and a local enhancement of $\\beta_4$ at the prolate minimum, indicating qualitative robustness with respect to the interaction. The resulting maps highlight specific heavy nuclei where highly deformed ground states are anticipated."

      "source": "arXiv for Nuclear Theory",
      "summary": "arXiv:2511.15129v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The norm operator method, which was recently proposed as a new formulation of the boson expansion theory (BET), is used to show that the subspace mapping is properly derived from the whole space mapping. This derivation requires the appropriate renormalization of the contribution of phonons that are not adopted as boson excitations in the subspace mapping. This was impossible with conventional BETs (which ignore these contributions), and is only made possible for the first time by the norm operator method, which treats these contributions appropriately. We also correct the confusion in the claims of conventional BETs. Namely, contrary to conventional claims, we show that when the phonon excitations not adopted as boson excitations make no contribution at all, the subspace mapping is obtained simply by discarding those excitations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Park operator, which had been considered effective only in the whole space mapping, is also effective in the subspace mapping."

We show that this puzzle can be resolved within covariant density-dependent point-coupling density functional theory by introducing an enhanced isovector tensor coupling. A nonrelativistic reduction identifies the resulting strong isovector spin-orbit interaction as the key mechanism that reconciles the PREX and CREX measurements."

Motivated by microscopic calculations showing density- and isospin-asymmetry-dependence of self-energies, we implement a new form for the baryon-meson couplings. The parameters for the couplings are constrained by a Bayesian analysis, which anchors the model to nuclear saturation properties, chiral effective field theory ($\\chi$EFT) predictions for pure neutron matter, heavy-ion collision data, and HALQCD-based hyperon potential calculations at 3-momentum $|\\mathbf{k}|=0$ in both isospin-symmetric and pure neutron matter. The resulting EoS satisfies neutron star mass-radius constraints from NICER and GW170817, providing another way to address the hyperon puzzle. The low-density part of the EoS is described via nuclear statistical equilibrium with modern mass tables (AME20/FRDM12, 8244 nuclei), providing a novel and complete general-purpose EoS for astrophysical simulations."

      "summary": "arXiv:2511.15693v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In this work, we investigate how short-range correlations affect relativistic hadronic models at high densities, with direct consequences for the structure of neutron stars, both with and without dark matter content. Two versions of the model are examined: one with vector self-interactions up to second order ($\\omega_0^2$) and another including a fourth-order term ($\\omega_0^4$). We show that SRC tend to soften the equation of state when only the quadratic term is present, but produce a noticeable stiffening once the $\\omega_0^4$ term is included. The corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff solutions for pure neutron stars indicate that short-range correlations reduce the maximum mass in the first case but increase it in the second. Extending the analysis to stars containing a fermionic dark matter component, within the two-fluid formalism, we verify that the same features appear in the respective mass-radius diagrams. In particular, the decrease of the maximum mass with increasing dark matter fraction is partly compensated by the SRC effects in the hadronic sector for the model with the fourth-order term. In all cases, the resulting parametrizations are consistent with recent astrophysical constraints, including the joint NICER-XMM-Newton analyses of the pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, as well as the gravitational-wave event GW190425."

These properties are essential for advancing nuclear clock technology and probing fundamental physics. Combining our isotope shift parameters with experimental data, we estimate highly accurate values of the differential nuclear charge radii for $^{232,229}$Th and $^{229m,229}$Th. Additionally, we determine the nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments for both the ground and isomeric states of $^{229}$Th by combining measured hyperfine structure constants with our theoretical calculations. Our precise evaluations of electric dipole polarizabilities and hyperfine-induced quadrupole moments are critical for assessing systematic uncertainties in $^{229}$Th$^{3+}$-based nuclear clock. Notably, we observe unexpectedly significant contributions from higher-order relativistic effects and excitations involving orbitals with higher angular momentum, which markedly influence the energies of the ground state and its fine-structure partner. These results highlight the substantial challenges in achieving highly accurate predictions for these properties."

A clear enhancement at small relative momenta has been observed in the correlation function. Through a Bayesian inference analysis, the source size parameters as a function of collision centrality and the spin- dependent strong interaction parameters (scattering length f0 and effective range d0) are extracted using the Lednick\\'y-Lyuboshitz formalism. The derived doublet spin state parameters (f0, d0) lead to a novel method to precisely determine {\\Lambda} separation energy for the weakly bounded hypertriton ^{3}_{{\\Lambda}}H."

This novel framework establishes a paradigm that directly links the nuclear physics description of matter (in terms of protons and neutrons) to the particle physics schema (in terms of quarks and gluons). Our analysis of high-energy data from lepton Deep-Inelastic Scattering, Drell-Yan, and W/Z production simultaneously extracts the universal effective distribution of quarks and gluons inside correlated nucleon pairs, and their nucleus-specific fractions. The successful extraction of these universal distributions marks a significant advance in our understanding of nuclear structure, as it directly connects nucleon-level and parton-level quantities."

By constructing all possible hadron-yield ratios from a chosen set of species and transforming them into an orthogonal PCA basis, the method removes linear redundancies and eliminates the information loss and systematic uncertainties associated with ratio selection. Energy-wise Bayesian calibration of the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model is then performed directly in this decorrelated space, with a Gaussian Process emulator enabling fast and accurate model evaluations. A detailed Sobol sensitivity analysis, together with the PCA loading structure, identifies the most informative ratio combinations and reveals a transition from chemical-potential--dominated to temperature-controlled freeze-out with increasing $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. The calibrated model reproduces all measured ratios, and the extracted freeze-out parameters are consistent with previous HRG determinations."
