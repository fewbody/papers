The moment of inertia of pair rotation (P-MoI) has been used as an indicator of pair condensation. [Purpose] We aim to elucidate the fundamental properties of the P-MoI, particularly its dependence on the particle number and the order parameter. [Method] The P-MoI was evaluated using the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) calculations with a monopole pairing Hamiltonian and Skyrme density functional theory calculations with different density-dependent pairing energy density functionals. [Results] In open-shell nuclei, a negative correlation was found between the P-MoI and the pair amplitude, which is the order parameter for the transition from the normal phase to the superconducting phase. Analysis based on the decomposition of the P-MoI into the orbital contributions within the BCS approximation shows that its orbital dependence is very similar to that of the pairing gap. [Conclusions] The P-MoI reflects the influence of both the level density near the Fermi energy and the pair amplitude."

The method combines the well-known $R$-matrix approach with the analysis based on the semi-analytic representation of the Jost functions. It is shown that such a combination has the advantages of both these approaches, namely, the number of the fitting parameters remains relatively small (as for the $R$-matrix approach) and the proper analytic structure of the $S$-matrix is preserved (as for the Jost function method). It is also shown that the new formalism, although closely related to the $R$-matrix method, has the benefit of no dependence on an arbitrary channel radius. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are tested using a model single-channel potential. Artificial ``experimental'' data generated with this potential are fitted, and its known resonances are successfully recovered as zeros of the Jost function on the appropriate sheet of the Riemann surface of the energy."

We generalize the extended relaxation time approach to incorporate multiple quasi-particle species and obtain the corresponding expressions for the shear ($\\eta_s$) and bulk ($\\zeta_s$) viscous coefficients. As an application, we study the temperature dependence of the transport coefficients of hot QCD medium with quasi-gluon and (light and strange) quasi-quark sectors considering the power law ansatz for the momentum dependence of the relaxation time. We explore the impact of the power law exponent on the ratio $\\zeta_s/\\eta_s$.

      "summary": "arXiv:2504.11685v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The many-body nature of nuclear physics problems poses significant computational challenges. These challenges become even more pronounced when studying the resonance states of nuclear systems, which are governed by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Quantum computing, particularly for quantum many-body systems, offers a promising alternative, especially within the constraints of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work aims to simulate nuclear resonances using quantum algorithms by developing a variational framework compatible with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and implementing it fully on a quantum simulator. We employ the complex scaling technique to extract resonance positions classically and adapt it for quantum simulations using a two-step algorithm. First, we transform the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian into a Hermitian form by using the energy variance as a cost function within a variational framework. Second, we perform theta-trajectory calculations to determine optimal resonance positions in the complex energy plane. To address resource constraints on NISQ devices, we utilize Gray Code (GC) encoding to reduce qubit requirements. We first validate our approach using a schematic potential model that mimics a nuclear potential, successfully reproducing known resonance energies with high fidelity. We then extend the method to a more realistic alpha-alpha nuclear potential and compute the resonance energies with a basis size of 16, using only four qubits. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that the complete theta-trajectory method can be implemented on a quantum computer without relying on any classical input beyond the Hamiltonian. The results establish a scalable and efficient quantum framework for simulating resonance phenomena in nuclear systems. This work represents a significant step toward quantum simulations of open quantum systems."

The nuclear shell-model calculations providing deeper insights into the properties of atomic nuclei, is one such case with high demand for resources as the size of the Hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of particles involved. Quantum algorithms are being developed to overcome these challenges and advance such calculations. To develop quantum circuits for the nuclear shell-model, leveraging the capabilities of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We aim to minimize resource requirements (specifically in terms of qubits and gates) and strive to reduce the impact of noise by employing relevant mitigation techniques. We achieve noise resilience by designing an optimized ansatz for the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based on Givens rotations and incorporating qubit-ADAPT-VQE in combination with variational quantum deflation (VQD) to compute ground and excited states incorporating the zero-noise extrapolation mitigation technique. Furthermore, the qubit requirements are significantly reduced by mapping the basis states to qubits using Gray code encoding and generalizing transformations of fermionic operators to efficiently represent manybody states. By employing the noise-resilient protocols, we achieve the ground and excited state energy levels of 38Ar and 6Li with better accuracy. These energy levels are presented for noiseless simulations, noisy conditions, and after applying noise mitigation techniques. Results are compared for Jordan Wigner and Gray code encoding using VQE, qubit-ADAPT-VQE, and VQD. Our work highlights the potential of noise-resilient protocols to leverage the full potential of NISQ devices in scaling the nuclear shell model calculations."

In this regime, the relaxation rate of weak interactions becomes comparable to the characteristic frequencies of composition g-modes in the core, resulting in resonant damping. To capture this effect, we introduce the dynamic sound speed, a complex, frequency-dependent generalization of the adiabatic sound speed that encodes both the restoring force and the dissipative effects of bulk compression. Using realistic weak reaction rates and three representative equations of state, we compute the complex frequencies of composition g-modes with finite-temperature profiles. We find that bulk viscous damping becomes increasingly significant with temperature and can completely suppress composition g-modes. In contrast, the f-mode remains largely unaffected by bulk viscosity due to its nearly divergence-free character. Our results highlight the sensitivity of g-mode behavior to thermal structure, weak reaction rates, and the equation of state, and establish the dynamic sound speed as a valuable descriptor characterizing oscillation properties in dissipative neutron star matter."

The $p$+$p$ baseline is provided by the Pythia8 event generator. The in-medium jet propagation is simulated by the linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model, which considers both the elastic and inelastic jet-medium interactions. Our theoretical results calculated by the LBT model show that the $\\Delta R_{{\\rm axis}}^{{\\rm WTA-Std}}$ distribution in Pb+Pb at $\\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV is narrower than that in $p$+$p$, which agrees well with the recent ALICE measurements. The narrowing of $\\Delta R_{{\\rm axis}}^{{\\rm WTA-Std}}$ seems to violate the $p_T$-broadening nature of the jet quenching effect, usually explained by the influence of \"selection bias\". However, the physical details still need to be fully understood. Utilizing a matching-jet method to track the jet evolution in the QGP to remove the selection bias in the Monte Carlo simulations, we observe that the $\\Delta R_{{\\rm axis}}^{{\\rm WTA-Std}}$ distribution becomes broader due to the jet-medium interactions. At the same time, by rescaling the quark/gluon-jet fractions in Pb+Pb collisions to be the same as that in $p$+$p$, we find that the fraction change may not significantly influence the modification pattern of jet $\\Delta R_{{\\rm axis}}^{{\\rm WTA-Std}}$. On the other hand, the selected jet sample in A+A collisions has a significantly narrower initial $\\Delta R_{{\\rm axis}}^{{\\rm WTA-Std}}$ distribution than the $p$+$p$ baseline, and such a biased comparison between $p$+$p$ and A+A conceals the actual jet-broadening effect in the experimental measurements. The investigations presented in this paper will deepen our understanding of the relationship between the actual intra-jet modifications in the QGP and the experimental observations."

These findings are supported by analysis of an ultrarelativistic ideal gas of quarks and gluons in the Stefan-Boltzmann limit. Additionally, we develop Boltzmann-Gibbs and Tsallis blast-wave models for finite-volume systems.
