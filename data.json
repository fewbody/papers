      "summary": "arXiv:2602.22383v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The intrinsic transverse size of nucleons, parameterized by a Gaussian width $w$, is a critical yet uncertain input in the initial-state modeling of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Using a finite $w$ in standard initial geometry models introduces an unintentional ``geometric inflation'' that alters the initial nuclear density profile. In this study, we implement a self-consistent density correction to eliminate this artifact and investigate its impact on final-state observables. Through hybrid (viscous hydrodynamics + hadronic transport) simulations of $^{208}$Pb+$^{208}$Pb collisions at the LHC, we demonstrate that removing geometric inflation significantly modifies the sensitivity of observables to the nucleon width $w$. While elliptic flow and mean transverse momentum ($\\langle [p_{\\rm T}]\\rangle$) become less sensitive to variations in $w$, the Pearson correlation coefficient $\\rho(v_{n}^{2}, \\delta p_{\\rm T})$, $[p_{\\rm T}]$ fluctuations, and triangular flow exhibit enhanced sensitivity to fluctuations in nucleon positions. Our results indicate that uncorrected geometric inflation can bias the extraction of nucleon structure and quark-gluon plasma properties. This underscores the necessity of a self-consistent initial-state geometry for reliable Bayesian inference in heavy-ion collisions."

We study its sensitivity to each of 17 model parameters in the context of 4 different models for particlization when switching from the hydro description to the kinetic theory afterburner. We find that the strongest sensitivity is to parameters relating to bulk viscosity, free-streaming time, and the $\\texttt{T$_\\mathrm{R}$ENTo}$ nucleon width parameter $w$. However, we find that the model generally has surprisingly little flexibility in describing the scaled spectrum observable, despite the large number of parameters.\n  Within this small range of parameter dependence, we further find significant tension in a simultaneous description of momentum-integrated observables. In particular, while the mean transverse momentum prefers a large value of the nucleon width parameter $w$, a small value is required to obtain scaled spectra that are consistent with experimental measurements. We speculate on the origin of these model tensions and possible missing physics in the commonly-used $\\texttt{T$_\\mathrm{R}$ENTo}$+free streaming+hydro+afterburner simulation model."

We demonstrate that this problem can be traced back to Bethe's assumption that nucleons in finite Fermi systems are independent random variables. By constructing a statistical ensemble that enforces rotational invariance through angular-momentum coupling, we obtain an analytical expression for the spin cutoff parameter, which includes a previously unidentified finite-population correction. Our results show that, even in the absence of interactions, nuclear many-body states exhibit non-negligible correlations arising from fermionic antisymmetry and angular-momentum coupling. From this perspective, spin cutoff may be interpreted as a quantitative measure of correlation imposed by symmetry in nuclear level statistics."

The calculations are performed for central Au+Au collisions at energies $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3 -- 19.6 GeV. These $V_4$ indicate optimal collision-energy ranges for realizing macroscopic high baryon-density matter. It is found that the 3FD four-volumes noticeably exceed those in the JAM, which indicates a stronger baryon stopping in the 3FD model as compared to that JAM. It is argued that this difference in the baryon stopping correlates with stiffness of the EoS implemented in these models. Contrary to JAM, the four-volume, where a baryon density ($n_B$) exceeds three times the normal nuclear density ($n_0$), does not exhibit a maximum as a function of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. It decreases monotonically with increasing $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, remaining at a fairly macroscopic level (i.e. $V_4\\geq 5.5^4$ fm$^4$/c). For higher baryon densities, $V_4$ exhibits maxima in its dependence on $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. The optimal energy range for densities $n_B/n_0>$ 4 is located at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3.2--8 GeV.

We show that the apparent tension arises from an implicit constraint in EDF theory, which ties the density dependence of the functional at the dilute nuclear surface to that of uniform matter near saturation. Relaxing this surface-bulk coupling and independently constraining the dilute-density sector, while preserving realistic saturation and high-density behavior, yields EDFs that simultaneously reproduce the neutron skins of both nuclei, their electric dipole polarizabilities, and neutron-star mass-radius relations. The established correlation between the neutron-skin thickness and the symmetry-energy slope parameter L at saturation is retained but becomes substantially broader. The results show that current neutron-skin data do not require extreme values of L and highlight an underconstrained degree of freedom associated with low-density nuclear matter."

Utilizing the multichannel Resonating Group Method (RGM), my model explicitly includes 12C+12C and alpha+20Ne reaction channels (with excited states). This approach provides a consistent, simultaneous, description of fusion, elastic scattering, and 24Mg spectroscopy. Results for 12C+12C elastic scattering show excellent agreement with experimental data, significantly improving the single-channel approximations. Spectroscopic analysis reveals that 24Mg states and resonances are highly mixed configurations, contradicting the concept of pure \"molecular states.\" The calculated fusion S-factor is consistent with available experimental data and predicts both narrow and broad resonances near the Coulomb barrier. Main resonance widths originate primarily from the alpha+20Ne exit channels. The S-factor exhibits a decrease at low energies, providing a microscopic support for the hypothesis of fusion hindrance. This work is a first step towards a reliable theoretical extrapolation of the 12C+12C reaction to deep stellar burning temperatures. Future works should include the neutron and proton channels to provide a complete description of the 12C+12C fusion."

For scalar-vector coupling differences $0.15 \\lesssim x_{\\sigma\\Delta} - x_{\\omega\\Delta} \\lesssim 0.2$ and $x_{\\sigma\\Delta} \\gtrsim 1.3$, the onset of $\\Delta^-$ resonances produces a van der Waals-like instability driven by a self-amplifying feedback in the scalar meson sector, in which the $\\Delta^-$ particle fraction acts as the order parameter of a Landau-type transition. A Maxwell construction yields a sharp density discontinuity at baryon densities $n_b \\sim (1.3$-$2)\\,n_0$, separating a $\\Delta$-free outer core from a $\\Delta$-rich inner core. The resulting neutron-star sequences satisfy all current multimessenger constraints: maximum masses $M_{\\rm max} \\approx 2.15$-$2.25\\,M_\\odot$, radii $R_{1.4} \\approx 11$-$12$ km, and tidal deformabilities $\\Lambda_{1.4} \\approx 190$-$480$, compatible with NICER observations and GW170817.

These frequencies overlap quantitatively with those predicted for hadron-quark phase-transition interfaces, demonstrating that the mass-radius ``knee'', reduced tidal deformability, and $g$-mode spectrum conventionally regarded as signatures of quark deconfinement can be reproduced by a purely intrahadronic mechanism. This extends the masquerade problem from static observables to the domain of gravitational-wave asteroseismology, implying that a future detection of a discontinuity $g$-mode alone would not suffice to identify quark matter in neutron-star cores."

Furthermore, we argue that second-order quantum phase transitions separating the confined and deconfined phases are likely to exist.

This work investigates the $\\omega$ modes of compact stars composed of quarkyonic matter. The quarkyonic model, which describes a cross-over transition between nucleonic and quark matter treated as quasi-particles, is formulated within the Relativistic Mean-Field (RMF) theory using the G3 and IOPB-I parameterizations. This core is surrounded by a mantle of hadronic matter, creating a multicomponent stellar interior. The overall Equation of State (EOS) is governed by two key parameters: the transition density ($n_t$), the QCD confinement scale ($\\Lambda_{\\rm cs}$), which are varied to construct models consistent with current astrophysical constraints on mass and radius. We compute the complex eigenfrequencies (damped oscillations) of the fundamental and first excited $\\omega$ modes using the phase-amplitude method within a full general relativistic framework. Our simulations reveal that the admixed quarkyonic structure produces a unique $\\omega$ mode signature, distinctly different from pure hadronic or hybrid stars. The spectrum exhibits a strong, degenerate dependence on the EOS, where the stiffening effect of the quarkyonic matter influences oscillation frequencies and damping times in a characteristic manner. We also demonstrate that $\\omega$ mode frequencies for quarkyonic stars follow approximate universal relations, largely independent of the EOS."

In this study, we employ the GiBUU framework and reevaluate the proton decay search sensitivity for the $\\textrm{p}\\rightarrow\\textrm{e}^{+}\\pi^{0}$ channel by incorporating a typical event reconstruction performance in water Cherenkov detectors. Using sophisticated models implemented in GiBUU -- most notably the mean-field potential and Boltzmann transport -- which have been benchmarked against accelerator neutrino scattering data, in particular pion production, we find that the resulting proton decay signal detection efficiency and atmospheric neutrino background rate are comparable to those previously evaluated for the current and near future water Cherenkov experiments using $\\textit{ad hoc}$ nuclear models. In addition to pion final-state interactions, we evaluate the impact of differences in the Fermi momentum distribution of nucleons in the nucleus, as a source of systematic uncertainty, on the signal detection efficiency and the expected background event rate. We find that the uncertainty associated with pion final-state interactions is moderate, whereas the choice of Fermi momentum distribution can significantly affect the estimated atmospheric neutrino background rate and constitutes the dominant contribution. Our study provides an independent and complementary characterisation of nuclear effects on proton decay searches and helps to refine sensitivity estimates in the regime where systematic uncertainties become more relevant."

We use data obtained in lattice QCD calculations performed with highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ) for a range of light quark masses, $1/240 \\leq m_\\ell/m_s \\leq 1/27$ for different spatial volumes ($N_\\sigma$) on Euclidean lattices with temporal extent $N_\\tau=8$, satisfying $3\\,N_\\tau \\leq N_\\sigma \\leq 10\\,N_\\tau$. We observe that infinite volume extrapolated data for the order parameter agree reasonably well with the expected $O(2)$ scaling behavior even for physical ratios of the light-to-strange quark mass ratio. We quantify deviations from asymptotic scaling and perform a detailed analysis of the influence of finite-size effects in terms of temperature and quark masses at a fixed lattice cutoff. This is crucial for improving the reliability of the infinite-volume extrapolated estimate of the chiral order parameter and for a more precise determination of chiral phase transition temperature from direct Lattice QCD simulations."

Two types of window functions (abrupt and smooth) as well as two kinds of kinematic intervals (symmetric and asymmetric with respect to the spacelike/timelike flip) are addressed. It is shown that the window quantities for represented in terms of the hadronic vacuum polarization function , the Adler function D(Q2), and the R-ratio of electron–positron annihilation into hadrons are mutually equivalent only if the additional contributions due to the window edge effects are properly taken into account and the explicit expressions for such contributions are derived. The obtained results enable one to evaluate by making simultaneous use of the inputs for functions , D(Q2), and R(s) at various energies and an example of such hybrid assessment is provided. The obtained results also enable one to accurately compare the window quantities for based, e.g. on MUonE or lattice data with the ones based on R-ratio data, even if the window function covers different kinematic ranges in spacelike and timelike domains."

      "summary": "Through the application of a molecular model to band-head states in 9B, a prediction of the Coulomb energy difference relative to the 1/2+ analogue state in 9Be is calculated. Under such treatment, a positive shift in energy of 0.605 MeV is found to emerge from molecular structures defined by replication of experimental rotational-band parameters. Given the relationship between the spatial arrangement of clusters within the nucleus and the obtained Coulomb energy, it is also possible to examine nuclear structures using known Thomas–Ehrman shifts. Molecular structures built using the α–α separation, 2β, required to give Thomas–Ehrman shifts for both a 1.84 and 0.8 MeV candidate of the 9B(1/2+) analogue state (β = 1.89 fm and β = 3.18 fm respectively) are used to calculate state inertial parameters ( ). From these structures, it is found that a 1.84 MeV state ( = 0.407 MeV) agrees with the experimental K = 1/2+ rotational band inertial parameter ( = 0.41 ± 0.01 MeV) and a 0.8 MeV state does not ( = 0.191 MeV). Thus, due to the large α–α spacing required to lower the Coulomb energy relative to 9Be, the existence of a 0.8 MeV 9B(1/2+) analogue state is highly unlikely. Indeed, excitation energies less than ≈1.25 MeV for a 1/2+ state, corresponding to a normal Thomas–Ehrman shift, can also be ruled out."

      "summary": "In this study, we systematically investigate baryon number violating (BNV) nucleon decays into an axion-like particle (ALP) within a low energy effective field theory extended with an ALP, which is referred to as aLEFT. Unlike previous studies in the literature, we consider contributions to nucleon decays from a complete set of dimension-eight BNV aLEFT operators involving light u, d, and s quarks. We perform the chiral irreducible representation (irrep) decomposition of these interactions under the QCD chiral group and match them onto the recently developed chiral framework to obtain nucleon-level effective interactions among the ALP, octet baryons, and octet pseudoscalar mesons. Within this framework, we derive general expressions for the decay widths of nucleon two- and three-body decays involving an ALP. Subsequently, we analyze momentum distributions for three-body modes and find that operators belonging to the newly identified chiral irreps exhibit markedly different behavior compared to that in the usual irreps and . In addition, we reanalyze experimental data collected by Super-Kamiokande and establish bounds on the inverse decay widths of these new modes by properly accounting for experimental efficiencies and Cherenkov threshold effects because of the lack of direct constraints on those exotic decay modes. Our recasting constraints are several orders of magnitude more stringent than inclusive bounds used in the literature. Based on these improved bounds, we set conservative limits on associated effective scales across a broad range of ALP mass and predict stringent bounds on certain neutron and hyperon decays involving an ALP."

The approach is based on a global analysis of available deep inelastic scattering data for different nuclear targets within the rescaling model, combined with the effects of Fermi motion. The scale dependence is implemented through the DGLAP-evolved quark and gluon densities in a proton derived analytically at the leading order of QCD coupling. By fitting the rescaling parameters to experimental data on the ratio for several nuclear targets A and A', we obtain predictions for nuclear parton distributions, even for unmeasured nuclei. The effects of nuclear modifications are investigated with respect to the mass number A. We highlight distinct shadowing and antishadowing behaviors for gluons and quarks."

Furthermore, we inspect the propagation of electromagnetic waves and examine the optical properties of the QED vacuum in this scenario. Among these, we contemplate the combined effect of the LQG parameters and a homogeneous background magnetic field on the propagation of electromagnetic waves by considering issues such as group velocities and refractive indices of the QED vacuum, in detail. Finally, with the aid of the previously analyzed LQG-extended photonic dispersion relations, we re-discuss the kinematics of the Compton effect and conclude that an interesting nonlinear profile emerges in the wavelengths of the incoming and deflected photons."

These results demonstrate the role of scalar hair in altering the boundary of stable motion. We further explored periodic orbits characterized by rational frequency ratios, labeled by the index , and quantified how scalar hair affects their orbital energy and angular momentum. Based on these orbital properties, we computed gravitational waveforms from extreme mass-ratio inspirals where a stellar-mass compact object orbits a supermassive charged black hole with scalar hair. Using the numerical kludge method, we generated waveforms that exhibit clear zoom-whirl patterns with morphology visibly affected by . Our results show that scalar hair leaves distinguishable imprints on waveforms, suggesting that future space-based detectors could probe deviations from classical black hole spacetimes through extreme mass-ratio inspiral observations."

Generally, without higher temporal derivatives in the metric sector, 3 degrees of freedom (DOFs) propagate due to the breaking of general covariance. Through a Hamiltonian constraint analysis, we examine the conditions to eliminate the scalar DOF such that only 2 DOFs propagate, which correspond the tensorial gravitational waves in a homogeneous and isotropic background. We find that two conditions are needed, each of which can eliminate half of a DOF. The second condition can be further classified into two cases according to its effect on the Dirac matrix. We also apply the formal conditions to a polynomial-type Lagrangian as a concrete example in which all the monomials are spatially covariant scalars containing two derivatives. Our results are consistent with a previous analysis based on the perturbative method."
