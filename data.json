There are 171 cases are presented in model-dependent forms, including the modified Harmonic-oscillator function, two-parameter Femi function (2pF), three-parameter Femi function, three-parameter Gaussian function, and 97 in Fourier-Bessel series model-independent forms. Independent of density functions, the point-proton root-mean-square (rms) radii of the derived point-proton density show excellent agreement with each other. We identify cases where the tabulated data of charge densities and charge radii are inconsistent, and the deduced point-proton density distributions are inaccurate due to insufficient experimental momentum transfer coverage or inconsistent scattering experiments. For the widely used 2pF distribution, it is found that the surface diffuseness parameters can be empirically calculated from those of charge density, while the half-density radius parameters follow the $A^{1/3}$ rule. The derived point-proton density distributions can be used as input in nuclear reaction studies and compared with nuclear model predictions."

Previous theoretical studies predicted 16O + 2$\\alpha$ condensed states. However, in those studies, the strong mixing with non-resonant states made the identification of true resonant states non-trivial. Purpose: To address this issue, we aim to provide a more robust theoretical verification of the 16O + 2$\\alpha$ condensation. Our goal is to clearly identify the resonant states and predict their properties, such as decay widths. Method: We employ the real-time evolution method (REM), which generates physically important basis states using the equation of motion, minimizing contamination from the continuum. The analytical continuation in the coupling constant (ACCC) was used to estimate the $\\alpha$-decay widths. Results: The present calculations show much better convergence of eigenstates, and the $0^+_3$ and $0^+_4$ states showed remarkable isoscalar monopole transition strengths, which were in good agreement with the predictions of Ichikawa et al. The small alpha-decay widths for these states suggest that experimental observation appears feasible. Conclusion: The present results show the reasonable agreement with a previous work, firmly establishing the $0^+_3$ and $0^+_4$ states approximately 5 and 1 MeV below the 16O + 2$\\alpha$ threshold as candidates for the 2$\\alpha$ condensation around the core nucleus 16O. The REM proved effective in identifying these states."

This review classifies EoS models into hadronic matter, hybrid, and quark matter models, analyzing their assumptions, predictions, and constraints. While hadronic models characterize nucleonic matter, potentially including contributions from hyperons or mesons, hybrid models introduce phase transitions to quark matter, and quark models hypothesize the presence of deconfined quark matter cores or entirely quark-composed stars. By synthesizing results from recent theoretical and observational studies, this review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies used in constructing neutron star EoS, their implications, and future directions."

Generically, one encounters correlation functions of multiple currents which must satisfy Ward identities. At intermediate steps, however the Ward identities are obscured, and often violated by physically motivated approximation schemes. In this paper we outline a method to construct a representation of the aforementioned correlators that manifests gauge invariance in the limit of a heavy target (i.e., when recoil energy can be neglected). This representation then enables manifestly gauge invariant approximation schemes. Furthermore, the proposed representation naturally separates the largest contributions that dominate scattering amplitudes in the limit of a heavy constituent (e.g., proton) mass. We analyze elastic electron scattering from nuclei in detail, and also discuss radiative corrections to processes mediated by the weak interaction."

These methods are the three-particle relativistic field theory (RFT) formalism, the two-body Lippmann-Schwinger (LS) equation with chiral effective field theory potentials, and the two-particle relativistic framework proposed by Baiao Raposo and Hansen (BRH approach). In a simplified single-channel setting, we derive the conditions under which the infinite-volume integral equations from the RFT and BRH approaches reduce to the LS form. We present numerical examples showing that differences between these methods can be largely removed by adjusting short-range couplings. We also address a number of technical issues in the RFT approach."

Both ions are of interest for precision studies, including for atomic parity violation and searches for new physics beyond the standard model. Using the all-orders correlation potential method, including Breit and radiative quantum electrodynamics corrections, we perform high-accuracy calculations of electric-dipole (E1), electric-quadrupole (E2), and magnetic-dipole (M1) transition matrix elements between the low-lying s, p, and d states of these ions, as well as the excited-state lifetimes, polarizabilities, magic wavelengths, and magnetic dipole (A) hyperfine structure constants. By combining lifetime measurements with precise theoretical ratios, we extract high-accuracy determinations of the s-d_1/2 and s-d_3/2 E2 matrix elements. By combining hyperfine measurements with atomic theory, we extract parameters of the nuclear magnetisation distribution (the Bohr-Weisskopf effect) for 135-, 137-Ba and 223-, 225-Ra.

Analysis for pairs of pions is most common, due to their large abundance in the collisions, as well as well-understood theoretical formalism and advanced experimental methodology. It is usually performed in three dimensions in longitudinally co-moving reference frame of the pair, to maximize the amount of information obtained about the source. Similar three-dimensional analysis has also been performed for charged and neutral kaons. In contrast analyses for all other pair types -- either for pairs of identical protons, or for pairs of non-identical particles are only one-dimensional. The abundance of heavier particles is lower than for pions, while the theoretical formalism for such correlations, as well as practical experimental methodology is limited to one-dimensional case up to now. This work identifies specific challenges arising in the analysis of three-dimensional proton-proton femtoscopy and proposes a theoretical formalism to analyze them, as well as specific experimental methods to extract and fit correlations. A test and validation of these methods is performed on correlations simulated in the LHyquid+Therminator2 model, and demonstrates the feasibility of such analysis. The caveats in the theoretical interpretation of the results are discussed, by comparing the fitted values of femtscopic radii with the true characteristics of the source extracted directly from the model."

      "summary": "arXiv:2505.05429v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Quasi-universal relations are known to exist among various neutron star observables that do not depend sensitively on the underlying nuclear matter equations of state. For example, some of these relations imply that the tidally induced multipole moments are approximately characterized by the electric-type quadrupolar tidal deformability. Such relations can be used to reduce the number of independent tidal parameters in gravitational-waveform modeling, thereby allowing us to infer extreme nuclear matter properties more accurately and test General Relativity in an insensitive manner to uncertainties in nuclear physics. We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation into approximate universality of neutron stars. Our approach employs a semi-analytic relativistic stellar interior model, which extends the Tolman VII solution, thereby enabling a refined exploration of the tidal properties of nonrotating stars within a semi-analytic framework. The derived power-law relations among various tidal deformabilities -- referred to as the universal Love relations -- agree well with expressions in previous work found empirically. We elucidate how the equation-of-state dependence is suppressed in a particular combination of macroscopic physical parameters induced by perturbations and demonstrate that the relation between the moment of inertia and electric-type quadrupolar tidal deformability (I-Love relation) rests on the same underlying mechanism. Our findings indicate that the approximate universality of neutron stars can be attributed to low compressibility, consistent with some of the previous studies on the possible origin of the universality."

We explore the impact of physics beyond the Standard Model on the cosmic equation of state and the probability distribution for the formation of primordial black holes which serve as dark matter (DM) candidates. We argue that besides primordial black holes also droplet-like quark-gluon plasma inhomogeneities may become gravitationally stabilized for a sufficiently long epoch to distill baryon number and form nuclear matter droplets which upon their evaporation may enrich the cosmos locally with heavy $r$-process elements already in the early Universe."

The methods described in this paper constitute tools that can be used to investigate the properties of scalar functions used to define nuclear potentials and quantify their contribution to the uncertainty of few nucleon calculations. We demonstrate these methods in deuteron bound state and nucleon - nucleon scattering calculations. Backpropagation, implemented in the Python pytorch library, is used to calculate the gradients with respect to model parameters and propagate errors from these parameters to the deuteron binding energy and selected phase-shift parameters. The uncertainty values obtained using this approach are validated by directly sampling from the potential parameters. We find very good agreement between two ways of estimating that uncertainty."

This is due to the fact that Spiegel neglected the transit time of light, thereby allowing the transport coefficients to move outside the convex geometry compatible with causality (the \"hydrohedron\"). Here, we fix this pathology. First, we prove that the linearized radiative transfer equations are causal and covariantly stable by construction. Then, we repeat Spiegel's calculation accounting for the finite speed of photons. We find that the full transfer problem can be solved analytically. All the infinite (exact) transport coefficients arising from it fall inside the hydrohedron. Our analysis also accounts for isotropic scattering."

Lanczos provides more accurate energy estimates than multi-state fits to correlation functions with small imaginary times while achieving comparable statistical precision.

Here we point out that quantum decoherence can be captured by $\\textit{complex}$ saddle points in the Feynman path integral in much the same way as quantum tunneling can be captured by instantons. In particular, we present some first-principle calculations in the Caldeira-Leggett model, which reproduce the predicted scaling behavior of quantum decoherence with respect to the parameters of the environment, such as the temperature and the coupling to the system of interest. We also discuss how to extend our approach to general models by Monte Carlo calculations using a recently developed method to overcome the sign problem."

In the valence quark-stopping scenario, three valence quarks each contribute one-third of the baryon number within a baryon. Conversely, in the gluon junction-stopping scenario, the gluon junction is responsible for carrying the entire baryon number. At present, there is no consensus regarding which type of stopping scenario is correct. Based on a multi-source thermal model, our investigation indicates that experimental data analyzed in previous and present studies suggest that the valence quark-stopping scenario is indeed accurate. It is anticipated that this scenario can be further validated through electron-nucleus ($eA$) collisions at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC)."
