      "summary": "arXiv:2510.10118v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Quantum computing is emerging as a promising tool in nuclear physics. However, the cost of encoding fermionic operators hampers the application of algorithms in current noisy quantum devices. In this work, we analyze an encoding scheme based on pairing nucleon modes. This approach significantly reduces the complexity of the encoding, while maintaining a high accuracy for the ground states of semimagic nuclei across the $sd$ and $pf$ shells and for tin isotopes. In addition, we also explore the encoding ability to describe open-shell nuclei within the above configuration spaces. When this scheme is applied to a trotterized quantum adiabatic evolution, our results demonstrate a computational advantage of up to three orders of magnitude in CNOT gate count compared to the standard Jordan-Wigner encoding. Our approach paves the way for efficient quantum simulations of nuclear structure using quantum annealing, with applications to both digital and hybrid quantum computing platforms."

Our aim is to provide clear evidence of entanglement in their spin degrees of freedom. These final states can be generated from pure spin states of the incoming nd system, where both the neutron and the deuteron are strongly polarized by maximizing the occupation of a specific magnetic substate. To fully characterize the final configurations, we compute the corresponding spin density matrices using the high precision CD Bonn nucleon-nucleon potential. Among these pure final spin states, we identify strongly entangled, Bell-like states that include at most small admixtures of components diminishing entanglement."

Starting from explicit nucleon coordinates generated by the packing algorithm, the model provides direct access to charge, matter, and core--valence radii, allowing quantitative analysis of clustering and halo formation. The study covers one-nucleon halo nuclei ($^{11}$Be, $^{15}$C, $^{19}$C, and $^{8}$B) and two-nucleon halo systems ($^{6}$He, $^{11}$Li, $^{19}$B, and $^{17}$Ne). For the halo systems, the fitted geometric offset parameter $\\Delta$ exhibits an inverse correlation with the nucleon separation energy, reflecting the increasing spatial decoupling between the core and valence nucleons in weakly bound configurations. The framework also reproduces characteristic neutron--neutron separations and opening angles in Borromean nuclei and qualitatively captures the geometric arrangement of $\\alpha$ clusters ($^{6}$Li, $^{7}$Li, and $^{12}$C). These results demonstrate that a simple geometric framework can effectively capture the essential features of both halo and cluster structures, providing an intuitive and computationally efficient link between nuclear geometry, binding, and experimentally observed radii."

      "summary": "arXiv:2510.10795v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In heavy-ion collisions, as the two nuclei pass through one another and create hot and dense matter, part of their initial angular momentum is transferred to the fireball, generating a nonzero average vorticity. Understanding heavy-ion collision dynamics and its influence on key observables, including those used to probe the initial state or assess thermodynamics of nuclear matter, requires understanding the magnitude of effects tied to vorticity. In this work, we use simulations of non-central Au+Au collisions at $E_{\\rm{kin}}=1.23~A\\rm{GeV}$ to show that the rotation of the system impacts the space-time picture of particle emission and, in particular, leaves imprints on proton-pion femtoscopic correlations. Next, we use coarse-graining of the simulation outputs to extract the collective velocity as a function of position and time, shedding light on the dynamical origin of this effect. Moreover, we demonstrate that the displacement between the proton and pion emission centers quantifies the strength of the rotation and propose it as a new signal of vorticity in heavy-ion collisions."

In the present work, we develop a deformed one-parameter model to quantitatively study the influence of ultra-intense laser fields on the $\\alpha$ decay of actinide nuclei. Our calculations show that the $\\alpha$-decay half-lives of these nuclei can be altered to some finite extent under laser intensities anticipated at near-future laser facilities. Furthermore, we found that, from the perspective of the nucleus, the laser field's effect on $\\alpha$ decay is governed by the nuclear shell structure and decay energy. The $\\alpha$-emitting nuclei with lower decay energies and located farther from neutron shell closures are more susceptible to the laser fields. From the perspective of the laser driver, we proposed a bichromatic laser scheme to enhance the effects of laser fields on $\\alpha$ tunneling of actinide nuclei. With appropriate phase conditions and amplitude ratios, it is shown that a fundamental-second-harmonic ($\\omega$-$2\\omega$) bichromatic field can increase the time-averaged modification by one to two orders of magnitude."

In this work, we present the first DRHBc description of the proton halo phenomenon. The available experimental proton separation energies and empirical matter root-mean-square (rms) radii are reasonably well reproduced for the $N=5$ isotones, ranging from the stable nucleus $^{9}$Be to the drip-line nucleus $^{12}$N. In particular, the DRHBc theory captures the abrupt increase in rms radii at $^{12}$N, unambiguously corroborating its proton halo structure. The formation of this halo is attributed to the occupation of a weakly bound orbital with dominant $1p$ components by the valence proton, which contributes approximately $90\\%$ to the diffused proton density of $^{12}$N at large distances from the nuclear center. A shape decoupling between the prolate core and the oblate halo in $^{12}$N is predicted."

In the present work, we use solely microscopic nuclear modelling from TALYS to estimate actinides cross sections and angular distributions, and we compare the calculated MCNP k$_{\\rm eff}$ values for fast systems between the JEFF-3.3 evaluated library, phenomenological and microscopic modelling. The conclusion is that even if the evaluated library leads to the most adequate results, the microscopic nuclear modelling can reach very similar results for these integral quantities. It demonstrates the remarkable advances in the recent decades of microscopic nuclear reaction ingredients for applied integral observables."

The lack of classical solutions of the Euclidean Lagrangian of continuous systems further thwarts semi-classical expansions. To develop an analytic theory which provides insight on interacting two-particle tunneling, we use new results to derive the Bethe-Salpeter equation of a tunneling field theory with Yukawa coupling. We show that in the one plus one dimensional case a closed solution in the instantaneous positive-energy regime is permitted. We then compute the scattering amplitude in first-order perturbation theory and recover the Lippmann-Schwinger equation to confirm physical consistency and relevancy."

The soft component is described by a Boltzmann fit, while the residual spectra are identified as hard QCD-like fragmentation. After separation, the subtracted spectra show no evolution in the shape or peak position with multiplicity, supporting a two-component interpretation. Mean transverse momenta for both contributions remain nearly constant, while Pythia 8 Monte Carlo simulations confirm these trends.

Although chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model have been employed to explain this phenomenon, neither approach has fully captured the observed behavior. To address this discrepancy, we have extended the NJL framework by incorporating the Medium Separation Scheme (MSS). This approach isolates medium contributions from divergent integrals, allowing for a more accurate treatment of finite-density effects. Our results indicate a clear increase in the diquark gap ($\\Delta$) with increasing chemical potential, consistent with what is also seen in perturbative QCD predictions at high densities. {}Furthermore, the MSS-modified NJL model successfully reproduces the observed peak in the sound velocity."

Initial conditions for all parton-induced channels are computed using next-to-leading-order nonrelativistic QCD. We perform our analysis within the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid factorization framework, employing the JETHAD numerical interface together with the symJETHAD symbolic engine. These tools allow us to deliver predictions for high-energy observables sensitive to quarkonium final states at 13 TeV LHC. To the best of our knowledge, the NRFF1.0 sets represent the first-ever release of collinear fragmentation functions for heavy quarkonia that consistently includes all partonic channels within collinear factorization."

Three foliations of dS$_3$ preserve three-dimensional non-Abelian isometry groups, namely, the flat ISO(2)-invariant, the spherical (closed) SO(3)-invariant, and the hyperbolic (open) SO(2,1)-invariant slicings. I show that the fluids that preserve these symmetries, after they have been Weyl transformed to flat spacetime, give rise to three physically distinct and boost-invariant solutions of the relativistic dissipative Navier-Stokes equations: the well-known and widely studied Bjorken and Gubser flows, and a seemingly thus far unexplored solution that arises from the hyperbolic slicing of dS$_3$. The new solution combines the radial expansion characteristic of the Gubser flow with the late-proper-time applicability of Bjorken's solution, and features a finite, radially bounded droplet whose expanding edge resembles a free-streaming shockwave."
