      "summary": "Author(s): Matúš Rojik, Martin Schäfer, Mirko Bagnarol, and Nir BarneaThis work presents an extensive theoretical and numerical study of charged few-nucleon systems (pd, dd, and p-3He bound states and scattering) in the framework of pionless effective field theory (EFT) up to next-to-leading order (NLO). The authors treat the Coulomb interaction nonperturbatively, while NLO interactions, including three-body forces and a four-body force, are treated in perturbation theory. Special attention is given to renormalization issues. Only a mild cutoff dependence is seen, consistent with the expectations of power counting in pionless EFT. The results hold significant promise for ab-initio studies of charged-particle scattering at very low energies, with applications to reactions of astrophysical interest.[Phys. Rev.

Our analysis focuses on pairing correlations among like nucleons, neutron-proton pairing, and $\\alpha$-type correlations. By investigating $\\alpha$ separation energies and binding-energy differences along chains of fixed isospin projection and subtracting macroscopic contributions, we reveal a remarkably smooth and nearly universal behavior in the residual $\\alpha$ correlation energy. These results exhibit the parabolic trends characteristic of collective rotations in gauge space. We demonstrate that the standard definition of the gauge-space moment of inertia for like-nucleon pairing is dominated by macroscopic contributions from Coulomb and symmetry energies. Once these are removed, the remaining moment of inertia becomes negative. This suggests that the observed behavior reflects the loss of correlation energy due to Pauli-blocking effect. Our results indicate that $\\alpha$ correlations constitute a genuine collective mode associated with quartetting dynamics arising from the coherent coupling of two superfluid components."

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.11308v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The concept of seniority plays a central role in nuclear structure physics by classifying many-body states according to the number of unpaired nucleons. While exact seniority conservation holds in single-$j$ systems with $j \\leq 7/2$, deviations arise for higher-$j$ orbitals where residual interactions can mix states of different seniority. Surprisingly, certain states in systems with $j \\geq 9/2$ exhibit partial conservation of seniority, remaining solvable even when the symmetry is expected to break. This paper reviews the theoretical foundation of the seniority scheme, its connection to pairing interactions and coefficients of fractional parentage, and the conditions under which solvability persists. Particular emphasis is placed on the $j=9/2$ case, where two $v=4$ states with $I=4$ and $I=6$ remain unmixed under arbitrary interactions. We discuss analytical proofs of their existence, numerical studies, and supporting experimental evidence from semi-magic nuclei across five regions of the nuclear chart. Extensions to symbolic shell-model approaches are also presented, highlighting their utility in exploring wave functions and symmetries in many-body systems."

By including contributions from $t$-channel $K^*$ and $u$-channel $\\Sigma$ exchanges, we perform global fits to the total and differential cross sections for $\\pi^{-} p \\rightarrow K\\Lambda(1405)$ and $\\pi^{-} p \\rightarrow K\\Lambda(1520)$. The results show good agreement with available experimental data. For the total cross section of $\\Lambda(1405)$ production, the $u$-channel contribution is dominant, whereas the $t$-channel contribution plays the primary role in $\\Lambda(1520)$ production. Furthermore, the differential cross sections of the two processes exhibit distinctly different shapes, reflecting their distinct underlying reaction mechanisms. An analysis based on the constituent counting rule indicates that $\\Lambda(1520)$ is consistent with a conventional three-quark configuration, while $\\Lambda(1405)$ shows a clear deviation, suggesting a more exotic structure. Owing to the large branching ratio of $\\Lambda^* \\to \\pi \\Sigma$, the Dalitz process $\\pi^{-} p \\rightarrow K \\Lambda^{*} \\rightarrow K \\pi \\Sigma$ is also calculated. Our results demonstrate that reconstructing $\\Lambda^*$ via the $K\\pi\\Sigma$ final state is experimentally feasible. This study provides important theoretical insights into the production dynamics of these hyperon resonances, and suggests future high-precision measurements of the $t$-distribution at large momentum transfer at facilities such as AMBER, J-PARC, HIKE, and HIAF, which can further clarify their reaction mechanisms and structural properties."

An excellent description of experimentally measured abundances of H and He isotopes is obtained. We examine two possible modelling of in-medium effects as an increased in-medium effective mass, or an increased vector repulsion. We show that these physical pictures cannot be discriminated by the data. In both cases, the temperature dependence of the meson couplings leads to a faster weakening of the light cluster abundances with temperature than previous studies predicted. Possible systematic errors due to out-of-equilibrium effects affecting the experimental abundances, are considered by repeating the Bayesian inference with reduced information. The abundance prediction of the species excluded from the constraint is well compatible with the experimental data, suggesting that there is no a priori need of accounting for non-equilibrium effects or finite state interactions that potentially affect the deuteron yield."

So far, there has been no demonstration of extracting nuclear eigenstates using such method. Here, we tackle realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction in momentum space, including models with strong high-momentum correlations, and demonstrate highly accurate results for the deuteron. We further provide additional benchmarks in coordinate space. We introduce an expression for the variational energy that enters the loss function, which can be evaluated efficiently within the PINNs framework. Results are in excellent agreement with proven numerical methods, with a relative error between the value of the predicted binding energy by the PINN and the numerical benchmark of the order of $10^{-6}$. Our approach paves the way for the exploitation of PINNs to solve more complex atomic nuclei."

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.11283v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Recently, a novel approach has been proposed to compute parton distributions through the use of boosted correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge from lattice QCD, within the framework of Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET). This approach circumvents the need for Wilson lines, potentially enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of lattice calculations. In this work, we present the first exploratory implementation of the Coulomb gauge method for calculating nucleon unpolarized, helicity, and transversity parton distribution functions (PDFs). The calculations are performed on a Highly-Improved-Staggered-Quark ensemble with lattice spacing $a = 0.06$ fm, volume $L_s^3 \\times L_t=48^3\\times 64$, and valence pion mass $m_\\pi=300$ MeV, employing boosted nucleon states with momenta up to 3.04 GeV. Our lattice predictions for the valence-quark PDFs -- extracted from the real part of the correlators -- show good convergence with increasing nucleon momentum and are compatible with the most recent global analyses for all spin structures. On the other hand, the full-quark-channel PDFs obtained from the imaginary part of the correlators exhibit discrepancies between the two large nucleon momenta considered, although the results at the higher momentum are consistent with phenomenology. The discrepancies are likely driven by stronger excited-state contamination in the imaginary matrix elements, which is consistent with the observation in the literature. Overall, this work demonstrates the efficacy of the Coulomb gauge approach for nucleon PDFs and serves as a benchmark for its broader applications."

Oxygen nucleus configurations are sampled using a $\\alpha$-cluster model to evaluate both formalisms and assess how initial nucleus configuration influences the properties of the produced final states. Results obtained through clustering are systematically compared to those derived from the Woods-Saxon nuclear distribution. The analysis encompasses various pseudorapidity intervals ($|\\eta|<$ 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0) and center-of-mass energies ($\\sqrt{s}=$ 2.36, 5.02, 7.0, 13.0 TeV). Based on the resulting distributions, we examine the KNO scaling effect and fit the distributions with the double NBD model for parameterization, aiming to accurately characterize the observed results and elucidate contributions from both soft and semi-hard processes. Our results indicate that different geometric descriptions of the oxygen nucleus project significantly different multiplicities of charged particles, especially for large multiplicities and higher pseudorapidity. We also observed that multiplicity of charged particles calculated with Pythia reveals significantly different behavior from that calculated with $k_T$-factorization."

We find that dimensionless observables such as the entropy density $s/T^3$, the pressure $P/T^4$, the energy density $\\varepsilon/T^4$, the trace anomaly $\\Delta = (\\varepsilon - 3P)/T^4$, and the specific heat at constant volume $C_V/T^3$ are sensitive to both finite magnetic field and chemical potential. As the chemical potential increases from zero, these quantities rise in both the hadronic and quark-gluon plasma phases. In contrast, introducing a magnetic field suppresses them at low temperatures but enhances them at high temperatures. Furthermore, nonzero chemical potential and magnetic field introduce nontrivial modifications to the squared speed of sound $c_s^2$. Both effects increase $c_s^2$ close to the critical temperature while reducing it at lower temperatures. When the chemical potential and magnetic field are present simultaneously, their influences superimpose, leading to more intricate changes in the thermodynamic behavior. Finally, we compare our results with the lattice QCD data for the quadratic fluctuations of conserved charges and their correlations. The model successfully reproduces the temperature dependence of these observables at $eB=0$ and 0.04 GeV$^2$. However, at the stronger field strength $eB=0.14$ GeV$^2$, the model underestimates the magnitudes while still capturing the overall temperature trend."

In reality, however, when a specific interaction Hamiltonian is given, different baryons should have unequal oscillator frequencies due to distinct interaction potentials induced by their different quantum numbers. In this work, we develop a new quark-level RGM formalism for baryon-baryon systems with unequal oscillator frequencies, with the aim of describing both single baryons and baryon-baryon interactions in a consistent framework. We present the formalism for solving bound-state and scattering problems, with particular emphasis on constructing the wave functions of two-baryon systems with unequal oscillator frequencies. The proposed formalism is then applied to the $N\\Delta$ system within a chiral SU(3) quark model, where the quark-quark interaction includes, in addition to the one-gluon exchange (OGE) and a phenomenological confinement potential, the nonet scalar and pseudoscalar meson exchanges arising from the spontaneous breaking of chiral SU(3) symmetry. The distinctive features of the newly developed formalism are elucidated by comparing the results from the new formulation with those from traditional calculations."

We also generalize the Young tensor method to the non-relativistic cases through the $SU(2)$ semi-standard Young tableaux, which allows for the construction of operator bases with repeated fields at any given mass dimension. Utilizing the Young tensor technique and Hibert series as cross-check, we obtain the complete operator bases for the following cases: heavy particle (and also heavy quark) effective theory operators up to mass dimension 9; pion-less effective theory operators, including nucleon-nucleon contact interactions up to $\\mathcal{O}(Q^4)$ and three-nucleon interactions at $\\mathcal{O}(Q^2)$; and finally the spin-1/2 dark matter-nucleon operators up to $\\mathcal{O}(v^4)$."
