The variation of flow fluctuations with impact parameter displays direct evidence of viscous damping, which is larger for higher Fourier harmonics, in line with expectations from hydrodynamics. We use intensive measures of non-Gaussian flow fluctuations, which have reduced dependence on centrality. We infer from ATLAS data the magnitude of these intensive non-Gaussianities in each Fourier harmonic. They provide data-driven estimates of response coefficients to initial anisotropies, without resorting to any specific microscopic model of initial conditions. These estimates agree with viscous hydrodynamic calculations."

By calculating $a_2$ in light nuclei using the chiral N$^4$LO nuclear force, including the ground state and excited states, and isobaric analog states in neighboring nuclei, we find that $a_2$ is close in isobaric analog states, while it varies in excited or isomeric states.

Specifically, the electric dipole polarizability, measured with high precision in various neutron-rich nuclei, serves as a robust constraint on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. In this Letter, we employ a class of relativistic energy density functionals in a twofold process: first, to link the electric dipole polarizability from recent experiments to the slope of the symmetry energy, and second, to translate this information into constraints on the tidal deformability and radii of neutron stars, in connection with multimessenger astrophysical observations from pulsars and binary neutron stars. We provide compelling evidence that the electric dipole polarizability represents a key nuclear observable to probe the neutron star properties. By significantly reducing the uncertainties in the mass-radius plane, our findings also align with recent multimessenger observations."

We explicitly address various limits with respect to system size, angular frequency and chemical potential. We demonstrate that, in this model, the critical temperatures of both transitions diminish in response to the increasing rotation, being in contradiction with the first-principle lattice results. In the limit of large volume, the thermodynamics of the model is consistent with the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. We also compute the mechanical characteristics of rotating plasma such as the moment of inertia and the $K_4$ shape coefficient."

In this study, we demonstrate that the overlap of the virtual Majorana neutrino wavefunction, predominantly composed of a right-handed antineutrino component with a strongly suppressed left-handed component (with amplitude proportional to the effective Majorana neutrino mass, $|m_{\\beta\\beta}|$, is crucial for triggering this decay process. This effective mass, derived from the minimum neutrino mass, offers valuable insights into the absolute neutrino mass scale. Using best-fit parameters from neutrino oscillation experiments, the minimum neutrino mass is determined from the sum of the three neutrino mass eigenstates, $\\Sigma = m_1 + m_2 + m_3,$ which is represented by two narrow bands centered at approximately 0.06 eV/c$^2$ for the normal hierarchy (NH) and 0.102 eV/c$^2$ for the inverted hierarchy (IH). Under these constraints, the minimum neutrino mass is found to be 0.001186 eV/c$^2$ for NH and 0.002646 eV/c$^2$ for IH, thereby establishing a potential absolute neutrino mass scale for both scenarios. From these values, we calculate $|m_{\\beta\\beta}|$, which plays a central role in $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay. By combining $|m_{\\beta\\beta}|$ with decay phase-space factors, nuclear matrix elements, and the absorption probability of the virtual Majorana neutrino, we estimate the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ half-life for key isotopes, namely, $^{76}$Ge, $^{130}$Te, and $^{136}$Xe, using two independent methods. The results are in good agreement, and we also discuss the uncertainties in the nuclear matrix elements that may affect these calculations."

The momentum dependent thermal width of the quark/antiquark that enters into the expression of the viscosities as a dynamical input containing interactions, has been obtained from the $2\\to2$ scattering processes mediated via the collective mesonic modes in scalar and pseudoscalar chanels encoded in respective in-medium polarization functions having explicit temperature and CCP dependence.

Under the equal-velocity combination mechanism of constituent quarks at hadronization, we build analytical formulas of anisotropic flows of hadrons in terms of those of quarks just before hadronization. We systematically analyze the contribution of higher order flows of quarks, and show how simple formulas of $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ of identified hadrons with the desired precision can be obtained by neglecting the small contribution of higher order flows of quarks.

Our formalism is based on the Schwinger-Dyson equation, employing a specific symmetry-preserving vector-vector flavor-dressed contact interaction model of quarks in Landau gauge, utilizing the rainbow-Ladder truncation. We derive expressions for the dressed quark mass $M_f$ and effective potential $\\Omega^{f}$ at zero, at finite temperature $T$ and the quark chemical potential $\\mu$. The transition between chiral symmetry breaking and restoration is triggered by the effective potential of the contact interaction, whereas the confinement and deconfinement transition is approximated from the confinement length scale $\\tilde{\\tau}_{ir}$. Our analysis reveals that at $(T = \\mu = 0)$, increasing $N_f$ leads to the restoration of chiral symmetry and the deconfinement of quarks when $N_f$ reaches its critical value, $N^{c}_{f} \\approx 8$. At this critical value, In the chiral limit ($m_f = 0$), the global minimum of the effective potential occurs at the point where the dressed quark mass approaches zero ($M_f \\rightarrow 0$). However, when a bare quark mass of $m_f = 7$ MeV is introduced, the global minimum shifts slightly to a nonzero value, approaching $M_f \\rightarrow m_f$. At finite $T$ and $\\mu$, we illustrate the QCD phase diagram in the $(T^{\\chi,C}_{c} -\\mu)$ plane, for various numbers of light quark flavors, noting that both the critical temperature $T_c$ and the critical chemical potential $\\mu_c $ for chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement decrease as $ N_f $ increases. Moreover, the critical endpoint $(T_{EP}, \\mu_{EP})$ also shifts to lower values with increasing $N_f $. Our findings are consistent with other low-energy QCD approaches."

This approach is also used to evaluated an ``effective potential'' from the yields.\n  Results: Several Gaussian functions are usually required to fit yields from non-harmonic potentials associated with a unique theoretical mode. Similarly, ``effective fission modes'', defined from the wells of the effective potentials, are sometime very different to the Gaussian modes. For instance, the S1 and S2 Brosa modes contribute to the same effective potential well at scission.\n  Conclusions: Gaussian fits are useful to identify the role of shell effects in fission.

      "summary": "arXiv:2408.10298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We study observational signatures of the hadron-quark crossover in binary-neutron-star mergers by numerical-relativity simulations with various mass configurations. We employ two equations of state (EoSs) for matter consistent with inference from the observational data. In the crossover scenario the EoS is softened in a density realized in binary-neutron-star mergers and is smoothly continued to quark matter. In the phase transition scenario without crossover, the EoS remains stiff and a first-order phase transition takes place in a density out of reach of mergers. A GW170817-like system forms a remnant massive neutron star in both scenarios, and it collapses into a black hole only in the crossover scenario due to the softening while gravitational-wave emission is strong. This difference is clearly reflected in the sudden shutdown of gravitational waves. For a given EoS, the lifetime of the merger remnant is determined primarily by the total mass of the system. Identifying these features in a variety of future events with the next generation of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors will enable us to clarify details of hadron-quark transition. The mass of the accretion disk surrounding the remnant black hole is affected not only by the lifetime of the remnant but also by the mass ratio of the system. Electromagnetic emission associated with the disk outflow will also be useful for detailed investigation of the hadron-quark transition."

      "summary": "arXiv:2411.13303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: To improve the theoretical understanding of multiquark states like $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$, we calculate the heavy-meson heavy-(anti)meson scattering potential up to next-to-leading order, $O(Q^2)$, within chiral effective field theory ($\\chi$EFT) employing a power counting scheme that explicitly keeps track with the large momentum scale $Q \\sim \\sqrt{2\\mu \\delta}$ (where $\\delta = m_V - m_P$ is the vector-pseudoscalar mass difference and $\\mu$ their reduced mass) introduced by the coupled channel dynamics. We provide expressions for the two-pion exchange (TPE) terms up to $O(Q^2)$ and their partial-wave decomposition. We show that these potentials are well-approximated by contact terms at $O(Q^2)$, with minor residual non-analytic TPE contributions, supporting $\\chi$EFT convergence in the theoretical predictions for $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$, as well as their spin partners. These findings are also relevant for $D^{(*)}D^{(*)}$ scattering, especially for the $T_{cc}$ state, for both physical and lattice QCD data with moderately larger pion masses. We further demonstrate that the differences between isovector and isoscalar potentials for heavy mesons are naturally explained by the TPE contributions."

      "summary": "arXiv:2502.19168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We calculate the nucleon mass in a manifestly relativistic baryon chiral perturbation theory up to the leading two-loop order. Through dimensional counting analysis, we perform the chiral expansion and verify the validity of the extended-on-mass-shell scheme at the two-loop level. As a result, we obtain the complete chiral representation of the nucleon mass up to $\\mathcal{O}(p^5)$, which preserves the original analytic properties and satisfies the correct power counting. The obtained chiral result is well-suited for chiral extrapolation and provides an excellent description of lattice QCD data across a broad range of pion masses. We find that the $\\mathcal{O}(p^5)$ contribution is small, approximately $10$ MeV, and varies only mildly with increasing pion mass, demonstrating good convergence of the nucleon mass up to pion masses of about 350 MeV at two-loop order."
