The high-order cumulant ratios $R_{n2}$ ($n>2$) exhibit non-monotonic variations across the chiral phase transition, characterized by slight fluctuations in the chiral crossover region and significant oscillations around the critical point. In contrast, distinct peak and dip structures are observed in the cumulant ratios at low baryon chemical potential. These structures gradually weaken and eventually vanish at high chemical potential as they compete with the sharpening of the chiral phase transition, particularly near the critical point and the first-order phase transition. Our results indicate that these non-monotonic peak and dip structures in high-order cumulant ratios are associated with the deconfinement phase transition. This study quantitatively analyzes temperature fluctuation behavior across different phase transition regions, and the findings are expected to be observed and validated in heavy-ion collision experiments through measurements of event-by-event mean transverse momentum fluctuations."

We introduce scalar and axial-vector phase-space functions as dynamical variables that parametrize both spin-averaged and spin-dependent distribution functions. Using spin-dependent Poisson brackets, we derive the corresponding kinetic equations and construct the associated Schwinger-Keldysh action. We further demonstrate how physical observables can be expressed in terms of these dynamical variables through constitutive relations. In the linear response regime, we establish a precise matching between the kinetic-theory and field-theory descriptions of vector and axial Wigner functions under electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations. Our framework provides a complementary approach to describing the dynamics of spin effects in a medium."

Utilizing \\textit{ab initio} configurations from Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory (NLEFT) and phenomenological $\\alpha$-cluster models within a Monte-Carlo Glauber framework, we compute the event-by-event variance of the initial net spin polarization. We find that the strong short-range spin--isospin correlations characteristic of $\\alpha$ clusters lead to a significant suppression of spin fluctuations compared to a spherical Woods--Saxon baseline with uncorrelated spins. By constructing a scaled fluctuation observable that accounts for trivial finite-size effects, we demonstrate that this suppression exhibits a non-monotonic centrality dependence sensitive to the detailed cluster geometry. Furthermore, we propose the ratio of scaled spin fluctuations between $^{20}\\mathrm{Ne}$ and $^{16}\\mathrm{O}$ systems as a robust probe. Our results predict distinct percent-level deviations from the baseline for clustered nuclei, suggesting that measurements of final-state $\\Lambda$-hyperon spin correlations can provide novel constraints on the ground-state spin structure of light nuclei."

In the present study, we extend that formalism by solving the full three-nucleon Faddeev equation without three-nucleon-force contributions in a three-dimensional approach in which momentum vectors are used directly as variables. This formalism is well suited for projectile energies in scattering processes above the pion-production threshold, where partial-wave expansions become inefficient. To treat the moving singularities of the free three-nucleon propagator, we introduce a new method that treats these singularities in a manner analogous to the simple poles appearing in the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. This approach evaluates the moving singularities directly through the center-of-mass energy of the 23-subsystem and eliminates the need to partition the q-domain into intervals. The resulting formulation opens a pathway toward a systematic investigation of the complex singularities in few-body scattering processes within the Faddeev framework."

The model could successfully capture two main mechanisms for dilepton production, $\\pi^\\pm$ and quark-antiquark annihilations on one hand, and self-consistently account for chiral transition and (de-)confinement on the other hand. Along the chemical freezeout lines, all the moments of the DER peak show similar extremal features as those of light quark mass, thus the DER can well reflect the change of chiral symmetry and criticality. More importantly, the DER can be directly measured in heavy ion collisions: Compared to the baryon number fluctuations, the DER fluctuations are found to be more drastic in the critical region and more sensitive to the relative location of the critical point. However, recent statistics of DER in heavy ion collision is not large enough to perform event-by-event measurement, instead we propose to study the baseline subtracted DER: For a given dilepton center of mass, the largest deviation shows up around the point where the light quark mass fluctuation is the strongest."

Using time-ordered perturbation theory, the scattering amplitude is obtained by treating the leading-order interaction non-perturbatively and including the higher-order corrections perturbatively via the subtractive renormalization. We demonstrate that the non-perturbative treatment is essential, at least at lowest order, in the SU(3) sector of $KN$ scattering. Our NLO study achieves a good description of the empirical $s$-wave phase shifts in the isospin $I=1$ channel. An analysis of the effective range expansion yields a negative effective range, consistent with some partial wave analyses but opposite in sign to earlier phenomenological summaries. For the $I=0$ counterpart, the $KN$ interaction is found to be rather weak and exhibits large uncertainties. Further low-energy $KN$ scattering experiments and lattice QCD simulations are needed to better constrain both $s$-wave channels."

While early times right after the collision are governed by far-from equilibrium dynamics, later times are believed to be well described by near-equilibrium dynamics. While the regimes of non-equilibrium are prohibitively complicated to describe within QCD, effective descriptions such as hydrodynamics provide a viable approach. In addition, holographic descriptions allow access to the full non-equilibrium dynamics at strong coupling. In this presentation, we review three examples of such hydrodynamic approaches and corresponding holographic descriptions: 1) non-equilibrium shear viscosity, 2) propagation of non-equilibrium sound waves, and 3) the non-equilibrium chiral magnetic effect."

We obtain an expansion of the Wigner function of the interacting quantum field in terms of the gradients of the classical thermo-hydrodynamic fields - four-temperature vector and reduced chemical potential - evaluated on the initial local-equilibrium hypersurface, rather than on the decoupling (freeze-out) hypersurface as usual in kinetic theory. The gradient expansion includes an unexpected zeroth order term depending on the differences between thermo-hydrodynamic fields at the decoupling and the initial hypersurface. This term encodes a memory of the initial state which is related to the long-distance persistence of the correlation function between Wigner operator and stress-energy tensor and charged current that is discussed in detail. We address the phenomenological implications of these corrections for the momentum spectra measured in relativistic nuclear collisions."

We resort to the Environmentally Friendly Renormalization Group approach, where the flow variable is taken as that describing the environmental conditions, in this case the strength of the magnetic field. We find the magnetic field dependent mass and coupling beta functions and use them to set up the differential equations satisfied by the neutral scalar mass and coupling. We solve the resulting system of coupled equations both numerically, and also analytically in the small-mass approximation. We find that the neutral scalar mass increases, while the coupling decreases with increasing field strength. The study is intended to set up the ideas to later use them in more sophisticated theories such as QED and QCD."

Using a static spectrum of charmonia in magnetic fields, we construct a multi-channel Landau-Zener Hamiltonian. Within this framework, we analyze the time evolution under several representative magnetic-field profiles, including linear ramps and Gaussian decays corresponding to single-passage dynamics, as well as Gaussian pulses realizing double-passage dynamics, and compute the occupation probabilities over a wide range of sweep rates and initial conditions. Our results show that nonadiabatic dynamics, including Landau-Zener transitions and St\\\"uckelberg interference, strongly influences the occupation probabilities of charmonia.

When one enters from Fermi Liquid to Dirac Fluid domain, Lorenz ratio becomes less than one in non-fluid framework but in fluid framework, it always remain greater than one for both domain. By compiling our outcomes and connecting with experimental data, a non-fluid to fluid transition framework is expected during the transition from Fermi Liquid to Dirac Fluid domain."

The $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay amplitude receives additional contributions from right-handed sterile neutrinos. The half-life, calculated in the effective field theory (EFT) framework, allows for an improved description of the contributions involving non-zero mixing between left- and right-handed $W$ bosons and those arising from exchanging a light right-handed neutrino. We find that the relative sensitivities between the low-energy (or high-precision) and high-energy experiments are affected by the left-right mixing. On the other hand, our results show how the interplay of collider and low-energy searches provides a manner to explore regions that are inaccessible to $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay experiments."
