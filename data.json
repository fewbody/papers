      "summary": "arXiv:2505.13691v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), while valid only at densities exceeding those found in the cores of neutron stars, could provide constraints on the dense-matter equation of state (EOS). In this work, we examine the impact of pQCD information on the inference of the EOS using a nonparametric framework based on Gaussian processes (GPs). We examine the application of pQCD constraints through a \"pQCD likelihood,\" and verify the findings of previous works; namely, a softening of the EOS at the central densities of the most massive neutron stars and a reduction in the maximum neutron-star mass. Although the pQCD likelihood can be easily integrated into existing EOS inference frameworks, this approach requires an arbitrary selection of the density at which the constraints are applied. The EOS behavior is also treated differently either side of the chosen density. To mitigate these issues, we extend the EOS model to higher densities, thereby constructing a \"unified\" description of the EOS from the neutron-star crust to densities relevant for pQCD. In this approach the pQCD constraints effectively become part of the prior. Since the EOS is unconstrained by any calculation or data between the densities applicable to neutron stars and pQCD, we argue for maximum modeling flexibility in that regime. We compare the unified EOS with the traditional pQCD likelihood, and although we confirm the EOS softening, we do not see a reduction in the maximum neutron-star mass or any impact on macroscopic observables. Though residual model dependence cannot be ruled out, we find that pQCD suggests the speed of sound in the densest neutron-star cores has already started decreasing toward the asymptotic limit; we find that the speed of sound squared at the center of the most massive neutron star has an upper bound of $\\sim 0.5$ at the $90\\%$ level."

To obtain complete information about these states, we calculate, using the high precision nucleon-nucleon potential AV18, the final polarizations of the neutron and proton as well as their spin correlation coefficients, which unequivocally define the corresponding spin density matrix. We compute all terms contributing to polarizations and spin correlations, e.g. not only induced polarizations and correlations resulting from unpolarized $np$ scattering, but also contributions from single polarization and correlation transfers from individual polarized incoming nucleons, and, for the first time, allotment to both quantities stemming from a doubly spin polarized initial state. We find that for the most part the final spin states are statistical mixture of states. The only pure states occur for highly polarized incoming neutrons and protons with maximal polarizations; however, these still contain components with each neutron and proton spin projections, and thus cannot be entangled."

To do so, we train an ML model on a bank of nucleosynthesis calculations derived from hydrodynamic simulations for events such as neutron star mergers where the rapid ($r$) neutron capture process can take place. Likewise we consider a bank of calculations from simulations of the slow ($s$) neutron capture process and also consider a few calculations for the intermediate ($i$) neutron capture process. We demonstrate that the ML does well overall in recognizing the $s$ process from the $r$ process, and after training on theoretical calculations ML stellar assignments match conventional labels 87% of the time. We highlight that this method then points to stars that could benefit from additional observational measurements. We also demonstrate that the ML assigns some of the presently considered $i$-process stars to instead be of $r$ or $s$ in origin, but likewise, finds stars currently labeled as $s$ to be potentially more aligned with $i$ enrichment. This first application of ML to classify metal-poor star enrichment using theoretical nucleosynthesis calculations thus reveals the promise, and some challenges, associated with this new data-driven path forward."

We find that the parton transverse momentum scale $k_\\mathrm{T}$ not only determines the geometric tilt of the QGP fireball but also significantly affects the rapidity dependence of both $v_1$ and $\\Delta v_{2}$, providing new insights into the splitting mechanism of $\\Delta v_{2}$.

By analyzing the $\\Delta v_{2}$ and $\\Delta v_{2}/v_{2}$ ratio, our findings provide new constraints on the uncertainties of the QGP initial state and provide additional constraints for refining model parameters."

We focus on a choice of the dilaton potential that leads to a holographic model able to reproduce known lattice QCD results for the glueball masses at zero temperature and pure Yang-Mills thermodynamics above deconfinement. Once the parameters of the background holographic model are fixed, we introduce probe fermionic and gauge fields in the bulk {\\it a la} Polchinski and Strassler to determine the corresponding structure functions. This particular realization of the model can successfully describe the proton mass and provide results for $F_2$ at large $x$ that are in qualitative agreement with experimental data."

These properties can be observed through the hydrodynamic expansion of the QGP. Experimentally, this was established by measuring azimuthal anisotropies in the final state, known as elliptic flow ($v_2$) or higher order harmonics such as triangular flow ($v_3$). These Fourier harmonic coefficients have been extensively measured in past experiments using inclusive charged particles or identified particles in the soft sector. Interestingly, measuring such coefficients using hard probes, such as quarkonia, brings additional information about heavy-quarks production and thermalization in the QGP. In this study, we investigate quarkonia collectivity using Run 3 data collected in 2023, presenting new flow measurements. We employ different experimental methods to extract flow coefficients, including the scalar product, event plane, and cumulant methods. These results will impose new constraints on theoretical models, enhancing our understanding of quarkonia behavior in heavy-ion collisions."

A statistical analysis is used to constrain the effective strong coupling in our model to available high-$p_T$ suppression data from central heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC, yielding good agreement with all available data. We estimate two important theoretical uncertainties in our model, stemming from: the transition between vacuum and hard thermal loop propagators in the collisional energy loss, and from the angular cutoff on the radiated gluon momentum. We find, consistently, that the extracted $\\alpha_s$ remains relatively unchanged across heavy- and light-flavor final states and across central, semi-central, and peripheral collisions. We make predictions from our large-system-constrained model for small systems and find good agreement with photon-normalized $R^{\\pi^0}_{d \\text{Au}} \\simeq 0.75 $ in $0-5\\%$ centrality $d$ + Au collisions by PHENIX. However, we find strong disagreement with the measured $R^{h^{\\pm}}_{p \\text{Pb}} \\gtrsim 1$ in $0-5\\%$ centrality $p$ + Pb collisions by ALICE and ATLAS; we argue that this disagreement is due, in large part, to centrality bias. We make predictions for the ratio of suppression in ${}^3$He + Au and $p$ + Au collisions, which may in the future be used to disentangle final- from initial-state suppression in small systems. We then compare our results to various subsets of data, which allows us to estimate the preferred: low-$p_T$ scale at which non-perturbative processes become important, scales at which the strong coupling runs, and scale at which vacuum propagators transition to thermally modified propagators in collisional energy loss."

It theoretically solves the ill-posed inverse problem that afflicts other theoretical approaches to collinear PDFs, such as short-distance factorizations. Recently, arXiv:2504.17706~\\cite{Dutrieux:2025jed} raised practical concerns about whether current or even future lattice data will have sufficient precision in the sub-asymptotic correlation region to support an error-controlled extrapolation -- and if not, whether it becomes an inverse problem where the relevant uncertainties cannot be properly quantified. While we agree that not all current lattice data have the desired precision to qualify for an asymptotic extrapolation, some calculations do, and more are expected in the future. We comment on the analysis and results in Ref.~\\cite{Dutrieux:2025jed} and argue that a physics-based systematic extrapolation still provides the most reliable error estimates, even when the data quality is not ideal. In contrast, re-framing the long-distance asymptotic extrapolation as a data-driven-only inverse problem with {\\it ad hoc} mathematical conditioning could lead to unnecessarily conservative errors."

For an inverted mass hierarchy of the light neutrinos we find that improved limits on $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ from next-generation experiments, assuming an improvement of two orders of magnitude on the current $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ limits will restrict the allowed parameter space for fixed mass splitting to narrow bands in the mass-mixing plane. Further combining this with the requirement to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis reduces these bands to windows in parameter space that are constrained in all directions and can be targeted by direct searches at accelerators, and restricts the mass splitting to values that can be resolved at experiments. For a normal mass hierarchy, restricting the allowed parameter will require even stronger $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ limits, and only parts of the parameter space can then be probed."

The NICA project is designed to provide colliding beams for investigating heavy stripped ion collisions at energies of 4.5 GeV/u. The NICA accelerator complex comprises several components: the operational heavy ion linac HILAC with an energy of 3.2 MeV/u, superconducting Booster synchrotron with a maximum energy of 600 MeV/u, superconducting Nuclotron synchrotron capable of accelerating gold ions to 3.9 GeV/u, and two storage rings with two interaction points currently under installation. The system includes two electron cooling units—one in the Booster synchrotron with a maximum electron energy of 60 keV, and another in the Collider with two electron beams, each with a maximum energy of 2.5 MeV. Additionally, two stochastic cooling systems are integrated into the setup. The status of the NICA accelerator complex, including its cooling systems, is presented. Experimental results from electron cooling studies conducted during the commissioning of the injection complex are reported. Plans for the further development and application of the electron and stochastic cooling systems are also described."

      "summary": "An axially quadruple-octupole deformed relativistic Hartree-Fock (O-RHF) model with density-dependent meson-nucleon couplings is developed in this study. In this model, the reflection symmetry is not preserved, and the integro-differential Dirac equations are solved by expanding the Dirac spinor on the spherical Dirac Woods-Saxon basis. The reliability of the newly developed O-RHF model is demonstrated by taking the octupole nucleus as an example, and the octupole deformation effects in are analyzed using the RHF Lagrangians PKOi ( ) and RMF Lagrangian DD-ME2. We find that the O-RHF models reproduce the octupole deformation of within the uncertainty of experimental results. Moreover, the presence of the Fock terms can enhance the intrusion of the neutron and proton waves, which leads to enhanced effects of octupole deformation for . In particular, owing to the repulsive tensor coupling between the intruding waves and the core of , the tensor force component carried by the π-PV coupling, which contributes only via the Fock terms, likely plays an unfavorable role in the occurrence of the octupole deformation of ."

To calculate the optical potentials of these mesons in different nuclei under study, we use the chiral (3) hadronic mean field model, in which the properties of nucleons in the medium are modified through the scalar isoscalar fields σ and ζ and scalar-isovector field δ. The scalar-isovector field δ accounts for the finite isospin asymmetry of different nuclei having asymmetry in the number of protons and neutrons. The binding energy and absorption decay width of mesons are calculated for the ground state and some possible excited states of the nuclei. In the chiral (3) model, the mesons , , and are observed to have a significant negative mass shift up to nuclear saturation density, which leads to the possibility of bound states at least for ground states and some excited states for heavy nuclei. For the pseudoscalar singlet and vector meson ϕ, the mass shift obtained are found to be small, and bound states are not formed. The present calculations are compared with those of different studies conducted in the field and are useful in understanding the outcomes from different experimental facilities focusing on this area of research."
