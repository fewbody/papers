We calibrate the two- and three-body next-to-next-to leading order (N$^2$LO) chiral forces using $A\\leq 3$ observables and perform precision quantum Monte Carlo calculations to compute the $^4$He binding energy. The predicted energy remains constant across cutoffs from $250$~MeV to $400$~MeV and agrees well with the experimental value, with discrepancies of order 100 keV.

This analysis is carried out using the GM1 and NL3 parameter sets under the SU(6) and SU(3) flavor symmetries in the relativistic mean field theory framework. Combined with the inferred mass and radius values of PSRs J1231-1411, J0030+0451, and J0740+6620, our results show that nucleonic direct Urca processes are absent in PSR J1231-1411 due to momentum conservation violation. In hyperon-containing PSR J0030+0451 (NL3 parameter set), the nucleonic direct Urca processes involving $e^{-}$/ $\\mu^{-}$ would occur. A large inferred mass span induces hyperon fraction variations, affecting neutrino emissivity. If the inferred mass of PSR J0030+0451 exceeds approximately 1.8 $M_{\\odot}$, the neutrino luminosity of the nucleonic direct Urca processes under the SU(3) flavor symmetry remains nearly the same as that in npe$\\mu$ matter, without depending on hyperons. However, it exhibits an obvious hyperon dependence under the SU(6) spin-flavor symmetry. For hyperon-containing J0740+6620, the nucleonic direct Urca processes under the SU(3) flavor symmetry in GM1 parameter set predicts faster neutrino luminosity decline with hyperonic fraction than npe$\\mu$ matter, and under the SU(6) spin-flavor symmetry in NL3 parameter set it shows monotonic decreasing trend. The research shows that hyperonic fraction significantly affect the neutrino radiation properties of the nucleonic direct URCA processes in neutron stars. Different-mass pulsars (e.g., PSRs J1231-1411, J0030+0451, J0740+6620) exhibit the distinct nucleonic direct URCA processes behaviors, dependent on inferred masses/radii, parameter sets, and theoretical models."

We investigate the implications of this measurement for the origin of nucleon mass within the parity doublet model framework, which naturally incorporates both chiral variant and chiral invariant mass components. We construct unified equations of state by employing the parity doublet model with isovector scalar meson $a_0(980)$ for hadronic matter up to twice nuclear saturation density, smoothly connected to a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-type quark model at higher densities through a crossover transition. By systematically varying the chiral invariant mass $m_0$ and quark matter parameters, we determine which values simultaneously satisfy all current astrophysical constraints, including gravitational wave observations from GW170817, NICER measurements of several pulsars, and the existence of two-solar-mass neutron stars. The inclusion of PSR J0614-3329 dramatically refines the allowed range of the chiral invariant mass from the previous constraint of $580~\\text{MeV} \\lesssim m_0 \\lesssim 860~\\text{MeV}$ to $800~\\text{MeV} \\lesssim m_0 \\lesssim 860~\\text{MeV}$, raising the lower bound by approximately 220 MeV. This result indicates that the chiral invariant mass must constitute at least 85\\% of the nucleon mass, challenging the traditional picture of nucleon mass generation through spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking alone and highlighting the importance of gluon condensation and other non-chiral mechanisms."

The expansion coefficients correspond to the properties of symmetric nuclear matter and the density dependence of the symmetry energy. The empirical values of the symmetry energy at subsaturation density and the density of crust-core phase transition are considered to limit the low-density behavior of EOS, i.e. $L_{\\mathrm{sym}} $, while the speed of sound of neutron star matter and mass-radius observations of millisecond pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620 are adopted to eliminate the high-order expansion coefficients, such as $Q_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ and $Q_{\\mathrm{sym}} $.

We employ the parity doublet model to incorporate chiral dynamics. Specifically, we contrast quarkyonic matter, in which quarks occupy states above the nucleon Fermi surface, with baryquark matter, in which quarks populate states inside the nucleonic Fermi sea. We find that while baryquark matter is generally energetically favored over quarkyonic matter, the self-consistent treatment of the momentum-space shell reveals that purely hadronic matter provides the lowest free energy up to densities well beyond nuclear saturation. Consequently, the contribution of quarks is not relevant within the model's domain of applicability, even though chiral symmetry becomes restored. This demonstrates that the onset of quark degrees of freedom and the restoration of chiral symmetry need not coincide."

By explicitly incorporating the color-superconducting pairing gap into the phenomenological model of a smooth transition from hadron to quark matter, we extend the known quarkyonic framework to include this essential aspect relevant at high densities. The momentum dependence of the pairing gap, motivated by the running of the QCD coupling and introduced similarly to chiral quark models with nonlocal interaction, is a novel element of the model that is crucial for enabling the simultaneous onset of all color-flavor quark states in the presence of color superconductivity. While asymptotically conformal behavior of the present model is ensured by construction, we demonstrate that reaching the conformal limit in agreement with the predictions of perturbative QCD is provided by the proper momentum dependence of the thickness of the hadron shell in momentum space. We employ the flexible meta-modeling approach to nuclear matter, analyzing the structure of the hadron shell in momentum space and focusing on the effects of color superconductivity in quarkyonic matter. Similar to the effects induced by the onset of the quarkyonic phase, color superconductivity leads to stiffening of the equation of state of the NS matter. This causes a significant impact on observable properties of neutron stars, which are analyzed and compared to recent astrophysical and theoretical constraints. We argue that the developed model of color-superconducting quarkyonic matter provides a new, consistent tool for studying the scenario of smooth quark-hadron transition in NSs."

To incorporate BLN effects, we consider the optimized perturbation theory (OPT) to the first nontrivial order, which includes two-loop (exchange) contributions. This procedure allows us to explicitly explore how finite $N_c$ corrections affect the thermodynamics as well as the phase diagram of chirally imbalanced quark matter. We then compare the results obtained with a sharp three-dimensional cutoff -- generically referred to as the traditional regularization scheme (TRS) -- and with an alternative procedure called the medium separation scheme (MSS). In the first case, we observe that the pseudocritical temperature decreases as the chiral chemical potential increases, an effect dubbed inverse chiral catalysis (ICC). On the other hand, when considering the MSS regularization, which properly isolates the medium contributions from the vacuum, we find the opposite result. We show that the results obtained with MSS are consistent with well-established LQCD data in both the LN and BLN approximations. Finally, we suggest that to cope with the high-density limit, the standard OPT interpolation prescription must be modified with the inclusion of an extra variational parameter."

Typically, the Lee--Yang edge singularities can be understood as a generalization of the critical end-point (CEP) between crossover and first-order transitions, where the positive Nambu phase and the Wigner phase coalesce. We further analyze the scaling behavior near the CEP by extracting the critical exponent associated with the Lee--Yang singularities. Additionally, we confirm that the extrapolation of the Lee--Yang edge singularity trajectories provides an effective method of determining the CEP location, even at a small real chemical potential.

The traditional view has therefore been that nuclei form via coalescence after the hot environment has dissipated. However, statistical thermal models, where hadrons are produced from a fireball at thermal equilibrium, can describe the relative abundances of light nuclei in pp and heavy-ion collisions at the LHC equally well. In this paper we investigate if balance functions triggered by protons and deuterons can be used to distinguish between the two production mechanisms. The coalescence model is investigated using PYTHIA, while the statistical thermal model is examined using the Thermal-FIST package. We find that for both models the same simple relation between proton and deuteron triggered balance functions is applicable. However, there is a striking difference between the two models when the transverse momentum of trigger particles is varied. This dependence offers a promising observable to discriminate between the two production scenarios that goes beyond nuclei production."

However, its accuracy is the result of a fortuitous cancellation of vertex corrections in the polarizability and self-energy. Hence, when attempting to go beyond $GW$ through inclusion of vertex corrections, the accuracy can deteriorate if this delicate balance is disrupted. In this work, we explore an alternative route that theoretically goes beyond $GW$: the parquet formalism. Unlike approaches that focus on a single correlation channel, such as the electron-hole channel in $GW$ or the particle-particle channel in $T$-matrix theory, parquet theory treats all two-body scattering channels on an equal footing. We present the formal structure of the parquet equations, which couple the one-body Green's function, the self-energy, and the two-body vertex. We discuss the approximations necessary to solve this set of equations, the advantages and limitations of this approach, outline its implementation for molecular systems, and assess its accuracy for principal ionization potentials of small molecular systems."

In this approach, the angular velocity appears only in a specific phase factor, allowing us to compute the point-split fermion two-point correlation function in flat spacetime. To ensure that the fermion correlation function is gauge invariant, we introduce a background gauge field that is fixed to produce a constant magnetic field. Using this Wigner function, we derive the energy-momentum tensor for this medium, which consists of both diagonal and off-diagonal components. By comparing our results with the energy-momentum tensor of an ideal spinful and vortical magnetized fluid, we establish a connection between these components and thermodynamic quantities, such as energy density and different types of pressure. We demonstrate that rigid rotation leads to pressure anisotropy in plasma. Additionally, we compute the associated vector and axial vector currents for this medium, utilizing the previously presented Wigner function. Our results are consistent with existing literature on the subject."

      "summary": "arXiv:2509.03509v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Quark and gluon scalar densities, $\\langle \\bar{\\psi} \\psi \\rangle$ and $\\langle F^2 \\rangle$, reflect the degree of scale-invariance violations in SU(N) gauge theories with fundamental quarks. It is known that $\\langle \\bar{\\psi} \\psi \\rangle$ can be usefully scale-decomposed via spectral density $\\rho(\\lambda)$ of Dirac modes. Here I give such formula for $\\langle F^2 \\rangle$, which reveals that gluon condensate is a strictly UV quantity. For the recently-found IR phase [1,2], where the infrared (IR) degrees of freedom separate out and become independent of the system's bulk, it implies that $\\langle F^2 \\rangle$ due to this IR part vanishes. Its glue thus doesn't contribute to scale anomaly of the entire system and is, in this sense, scale invariant consistently with the original claim. Associated formulas are used us to define IR decoupling of glue, which may serve as an alternative indicator of IR phase transition. Using the simplest form of coherent lattice QCD, we express the effective action of full QCD entirely via Dirac spectral density."

C 99, 034620 (2019)] for calculating various observables in the continuum and discrete spectrum using two-body interactions in single- and coupled-channel systems. This method is promising for many-body applications and ab initio description of nuclear reactions. We explore the convergence of phase shifts and wave functions as well as the location of S-matrix poles which enables obtaining both resonance and bound state parameters. We find that adopting wave functions from approximate bound-state solutions for the short-range components of basis wave functions leads to good convergence."

To this purpose, we begin by calculating the vacuum expectation values of a vector and axial vector current using the free fermion propagator in this medium. This propagator is derived by employing the Fock-Schwinger method based on the solutions of the Dirac equation in the presence of rotation and finite axial chemical potential. We present a complete derivation of these solutions. We demonstrate that in the first approximation, the chiral vortical conductivity associated with the vector current is proportional to the product of the vector and axial chemical potentials. In contrast, the chiral vortical conductivity related to the axial vector current depends on the temperature, the vector, and the axial vector chemical potential squares. We use the relation between the axial vector current and the angular momentum density associated with spin to determine the spin and the orbital moment of inertia of a rigidly rotating Fermi gas in a charged and chirally imbalanced medium separately. In addition, we compute the total moment of inertia by utilizing the methods presented in the first part of the paper and show that the orbital moment of inertia of a free fermion gas vanishes."

      "summary": "The equation of state (EoS) of hot neutron star matter (NSM) of neutron–proton–electron-muon (n+p+e+μ) composition in β-equilibrium is studied for neutrino-trapped matter under isothermal conditions, in a self-consistent manner where the thermal evolution is built upon its zero-temperature predictions. This has particular relevance in understanding the phenomena associated with a binary neutron star merger (BNSM). The antiparticles, positrons and anti-muons play a crucial role in deciding the composition of the matter at a low density region around 0.01 fm−3. The bulk viscosity due to direct Urca processes in the npeμ NSM is computed for both the fast electroweak leptonic equilibrium and the slow leptonic equilibrium processes of electron–muon transition. The study has been conducted in a non-relativistic mean-field (RMF) model using simple effective interaction (SEI). From the damping timescale calculation, it appears that bulk viscosity arising from the direct Urca processes is unlikely to damp the oscillations produced in the KHz range in the initial stage of hot binary neutron-star merged matter, in agreement with the findings of earlier studies."
