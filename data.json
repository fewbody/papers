However, sound waves change their properties when propagating through rapidly evolving anisotropic media, such as the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions. This paper uses $\\mathcal{N}=4$ Super-Yang-Mills theory to numerically study the time evolution of the speed and attenuation of sound modes along with the relaxation time in a plasma undergoing Bjorken expansion from various initial states in a quasi-static approximation. The longitudinal Bjorken expansion breaks the isotropy, resulting in two distinct sound speeds that range from just below the conformal value to the speed of light. An anisotropic hydrodynamic description is constructed and its applicability is discussed. Implications for the analysis of heavy ion data are considered."

Standard implementations rely on the smoothness and on-shell approximations, which effectively remove the relative momentum dependence of the particle emission function. We explore the validity of these approximations by deriving model-independent expansions that quantify the leading corrections for femtoscopy and coalescence with arbitrary sources and final-state interactions. The resulting first- and second-order correction terms can be evaluated with essentially the same numerical complexity as the usual Koonin-Pratt expressions; for angle-averaged correlations the first-order contributions vanish by symmetry. We illustrate the framework with explicit calculations in a blast-wave source model. For parameter sets representative of pp and PbPb fits at LHC energies, the corrections are at or below the percent level for pp correlations and deuteron coalescence."

In this work, we systematically investigate $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{np}}$ in the transuranium berkelium (Bk) isotopic chain using the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc). Our results reveal a general increase of $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{np}}$ with neutron number $N$, which exhibits anti-kinks at the shell closures $N = 184, 258$ due to the shell effects. By decomposing $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{np}}$ into volume and surface contributions through two-parameter Fermi (2pF) fits to angle-averaged DRHBc densities, we find that the volume term accounts for as much as $68\\%$ in most nuclei, whereas the surface term dominates only near the proton drip line for $N < 142$. Nuclear deformation is shown to slightly reduce the central radius $R_c$ while significantly enhancing the surface diffuseness $a$, resulting in a notable increase in $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{np}}$ that is largely driven by the surface term. Moreover, by extracting 2pF parameters along the symmetry axis ($\\theta = 0^\\circ$) and perpendicular to it ($\\theta = 90^\\circ$), we examine the anisotropy of $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{np}}$. In prolate deformed nuclei, a pronounced directional dependence emerges: although the nucleus elongates along the symmetry axis, $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{np}}$ is substantially larger in the perpendicular direction. This anisotropy is weak for oblate nuclei near shell closures. The anisotropy of $\\Delta R_{\\rm np}$ is attributed mainly to the volume term, which remains the dominant contribution in most nuclei regardless of direction. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between deformation, shell structure, and the neutron skin in finite nuclei."

      "summary": "arXiv:2602.03388v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: A major source of uncertainty in modeling the strangeness-rich interiors of neutron stars arises from the poorly constrained two-body and three-body interactions among hyperons and nucleons. We perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis of the $\\Lambda\\Lambda$ and $\\Lambda\\Lambda N$ interaction parameters within the Skyrme Hartree-Fock framework, constrained by both hypernuclei experimental data and astrophysical observations. Our results show that the parameter space of the $\\Lambda\\Lambda$ interaction is tightly constrained by combining nuclear and astrophysical data, while the parameters of the $\\Lambda\\Lambda N$ three-body interaction remain sensitive to astrophysical inputs alone. Specifically, the local, momentum-independent two-body interaction parameter $\\lambda_0$ is tightly constrained and predominantly attractive, while the momentum-dependent parameters $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ contribute repulsive effects at high densities. A key role is played by the $\\Lambda\\Lambda$ potential depth in pure $\\Lambda$ matter, which effectively constrains the two-body $\\Lambda\\Lambda$ interaction and governs the balance between attraction at low densities and repulsion at high densities. The repulsive components of $\\Lambda\\Lambda$ interactions then decrease hyperon fractions and reconcile hyperon-rich equations of state with the observed $\\sim2\\,M_{\\odot}$ neutron stars, increasing the maximum mass by up to 22\\%. The inclusion of $\\Lambda\\Lambda N$ three-body forces further stiffens the EOS, raising the maximum mass by up to $\\sim 0.1\\,M_{\\odot}$. Our study represents a promising step toward a complete, experimentally grounded description of dense matter across a wide range of densities and strangeness compositions."

This branch will be populated by stars comprising a quark-matter core and a hadronic-matter envelope, i.e., hybrid stars, which represent ``twin-star'' solutions to equilibria having the same mass but a fully hadronic EOS. While both branches are stable to linear perturbations, it is unclear which of the twin solutions is the ``favoured'' one, that is, which of the two configurations is expected to be found in nature. We assess this point by performing a large campaign of general-relativistic simulations aimed at assessing the response of compact stars on the two branches to perturbations of various strength. In this way, we find that, independently of whether the stars populate the hadronic or the twin branch, their response is characterised by a critical-perturbation strength such that the star will oscillate on the original branch for subcritical perturbations and migrate to the neighbouring branch for supercritical perturbations while conserving rest-mass. Because the critical values are different for stars with the same rest-mass but sitting on either branch, it is possible to define as favoured the part of the branch that has the largest critical perturbation, thus correcting the common wisdom that stellar models on the twin branch are the favoured ones. Interestingly, we show that the binding energies on the two branches can be used to deduce without simulations which of the stellar configurations is more likely to be found in nature."

The measured spectra are analyzed with the Tsallis non-extensive distribution, from which the effective temperature T, non-extensive parameter q, and the mean transverse momentum mean_pT are extracted for each particle species and centrality interval. To disentangle thermal and collective effects, the mean kinetic freeze-out temperature T0 is obtained from the intercept of the T-versus-mass relation, while the average transverse flow velocity betaT is extracted from the slope of mean_pT versus the mean moving mass for pions, kaons, and protons.\n  The results show that T increases and q decreases with increasing centrality, indicating a hotter and more equilibrated system in central collisions. A clear mass dependence of T supports a multi-freeze-out scenario, with heavier particles decoupling earlier. Both T0 and betaT rise from peripheral to mid-central collisions before saturating toward central events, which may suggest the onset of collective behavior or changes in freeze-out dynamics. These observations provide new insights into the thermal and dynamical properties of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC."

We perform state-of-the-art ab initio nuclear calculations, including all relevant argon excited states with energies up to 18 MeV, to provide reliable predictions for these signals.

The amplitude zero for the center-of-mass momentum near 0.35 GeV in the $^1S_0$ channel is naturally accommodated within this framework. We extract the pole position, scattering length, effective range, and the pseudoscalar pion-nucleon coupling constant $g_{\\pi N}^2/(4\\pi)$ at different expansion orders. The low-energy parameters are stable and consistent with established values, while $g_{\\pi N}^2/(4\\pi)$ exhibits larger uncertainties. The extraction of $g_{\\pi N}^2/(4\\pi)$ is data-driven, relying on the analytic constraints from the left-hand cut and phase-shift data within the one-pion-exchange approximation.

The effective potentials between baryon and meson clusters are given, and the possible bound states are also investigated. Also, the study of the scattering process of the open channels is performed to identify possible resonance states. Our estimations indicate that several possible bound states and narrow baryon-meson resonances are found from corresponding the calculation processes. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental measurement, we also extract the low-energy scattering parameters and compute the femtoscopic correlation functions for the $N\\bar{D}$ system using the CATS framework. The results demonstrate that the predicted $I=0$ bound state manifests as a significant enhancement at low momentum accompanied by a characteristic suppression. In contrast, the $I=1$ correlations remain relatively flat as the predicted resonances are kinematically distant from the threshold. The $I=2$ sector exhibits strong spin dependence, where the bound state signal in the $J=1/2^{-}$ channel is largely masked by repulsive components in spin-averaged observables. This cancellation effect suggests that future experimental searches at ALICE and LHCb may require spin-selective measurements to identify such states. These predictions provide crucial theoretical guidance for future experiments."

However, it has been recently argued that the theory in 3+1D with an $N$-component scalar $\\vec{\\phi}$ and a $(\\vec{\\phi}\\cdot\\vec{\\phi})^{\\,2}=\\vec{\\phi}^{\\,4}$ interaction term does have an interacting continuum limit at large $N$. It has been suggested that this continuum limit has a negative (bare) coupling constant and exhibits asymptotic freedom, similar to the $\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{T}$-symmetric $-g\\phi^4$ field theory. In this paper I study the $\\vec{\\phi}^{\\,4}$ theory in 3+1D at large $N$ with a negative coupling constant $-g0$ theory when the Landau poles of the two theories (in the $\\lambda>0$ case a pole in the UV) are identified with one another. The spirit of renormalization is that observables do not depend on the renormalization scale. Here we see even if the coupling is taken negative above the scale of the Landau pole, thermodynamic observables are unaffected. Thus the $\\vec{\\phi}^{\\,4}$ theory at large $N$ appears to have a negative bare coupling constant; the coupling only becomes positive in the IR, which in the context of other $\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{T}$-symmetric and large-$N$ quantum field theories I argue is perfectly acceptable."

While quarks conduct momentum flow through their kinetic motion and the gluon scalar (anomaly) contributes via pure interactions, the gluon stress tensor has both effects. The quarks momentum flow encodes the information of the color-Lorentz force density on them, and the momentum conservation allows to trace its origin to the gluon tensor and anomaly (a ``negative pressure'' potential). From the state-of-the-art lattice calculations and experimental fits on the form factors of the QCD energy-momentum tensor, we exhibit pictures of the momentum flow and the color-Lorentz forces on the quarks in the nucleon. In particular, the anomaly contributes a critical attractive force with a strength similar to that of a heavy-quark confinement potential."
