      "summary": "arXiv:2601.07987v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We introduce a general method to merge multidimensional equations of state (EoSs) by combining them in a two-fluid equilibrium statistical mixture in the grand canonical ensemble. The merged grand potential density $\\omega$ is built directly from the input EoSs and the fluid fractions are fixed by minimizing $\\omega$ at fixed temperature $T$ and baryon chemical potential $\\mu_B$. Thermodynamic consistency and stability are guaranteed as all thermodynamic quantities are consistently derived from a single merged grand potential $\\omega(T,\\mu_B)$ with the correct convexity properties. Our method can accommodate a first-order phase transition and a critical endpoint with mean-field critical exponents. We use this method to merge a van der Waals Hadron-Resonance-Gas EoS with a holographic Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton EoS that has a critical point and a first-order line. The result is a single EoS, spanning hadronic and deconfined matter over a broad range in $(T,\\mu_B)$, which can be readily used in heavy-ion hydrodynamic simulations. Our merging method can be generalized to consider a higher dimensional phase diagram (e.g., by considering more chemical potentials) and more than two input EoSs."

In this work, we employ a microscopic in-medium few-body approach to systematically investigate the formation and dissolution of light clusters (deuteron, $\\rm{^3H}$, $\\rm{^3He}$, $\\alpha$-particle) embedded in nuclear medium. The medium-modified cluster structures under the Pauli blocking and the picture of Mott transitions in nuclear medium are discussed in detail. We find that the weakly bound deuteron survives to higher densities as compared with the more compact $\\alpha$-particle in symmetric nuclear matter, with its r.m.s. radius expanding markedly prior to its dissolution. Moreover, the Mott density of $\\alpha$-particle is slightly lower in neutron-rich matter than in symmetric matter. These results may provide useful constraints for the formation of light clusters at nuclear surface and the cluster yields in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions."

The chiral 3NF derived from the chiral effective field theory has been successful in $\\textit{ab initio}$ studies of atomic nuclei. However, challenges remain, such as parameterizing low-energy constants and applying regulators. Most of established chiral nuclear forces have a nonlocal form in the momentum space. In this work, we construct local and hybrid local-nonlocal chiral 3NFs for the newly established Idaho local position-space two-nucleon potential, and calculate binding energies and radii of nuclei up to $^{132}$Sn. The two low-energy constants of 3NF are constrained by the ground-state energies of $^3$H and $^{16}$O, as suggested in a recent work. The chiral Hamiltonian obtained with the local-nonlocal regulator can simultaneously reproduce the experimental ground-state energies and charge radii of nuclei over a large range from $^4$He to $^{132}$Sn."

      "summary": "arXiv:2601.08245v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Disentangling reaction mechanisms in weakly bound nuclei remains a long-standing challenge, often compounded by the treatment of absorption as an incoherent sum of channel contributions. Within the Continuum-Discretized Coupled-Channels (CDCC) framework, we derive a generalized coupled-channel optical theorem and show that the total absorption cross section, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm A}\\propto -\\langle\\Psi|W|\\Psi\\rangle$, decomposes as $\\sigma_{\\mathrm A}=\\sigma_{\\mathrm D}+\\sigma_{\\mathrm B}+\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}$, where $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}$ is a coherent interference term between channel components. For the systems and fragment-target optical potentials considered, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}$ is negative and comparable in magnitude to the direct absorption terms. The off-diagonal imaginary couplings play a dual role, redistributing flux among channels and generating $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}$, which is required for flux-balance consistency. Calculations for $d+{}^{93}\\mathrm{Nb}$ and ${}^{6}\\mathrm{Li}+{}^{59}\\mathrm{Co}/{}^{208}\\mathrm{Pb}$ show that retaining the full non-diagonal coupling matrix substantially enhances breakup-channel absorption for heavy targets while reducing the total absorption through interference effects. Neglecting off-diagonal imaginary couplings therefore leads to a systematically biased physical picture, overestimating total absorption and severely underestimating breakup contributions, implying that experimental analyses based on incoherent-sum models inherit this bias. Full-coupling CDCC calculations are thus essential for consistent, mechanism-resolved extraction of absorption cross sections in weakly bound systems."

Taking neutron-rich magnesium isotopes as examples, the isovector electric dipole response, especially in the low-lying region, is studied. It is found that the low-energy dipole strength increases with neutron number and becomes notably enhanced in the predicted deformed halo nuclei $^{42}\\mathrm{Mg}$ and $^{44}\\mathrm{Mg}$. In these isotopes, the $K^\\pi=1^-$ states below 3 MeV are dominated by transitions from the ``halo\" part of the single-neutron orbitals. Their transition densities reveal a low-frequency, out-of-phase oscillation between the neutron halo and the core. These results provide a microscopic picture for the soft dipole resonance in $^{42}\\mathrm{Mg}$ and $^{44}\\mathrm{Mg}$."

Electrons in graphene follow neither non-relativistic nor relativistic hydrodynamics and thermodynamics. Present article has gone through systematic microscopic calculations of thermodynamical quantities like pressure, energy density, etc. of electron-fluid in graphene and compared with corresponding estimations for non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic cases. Identifying the Dirac fluid and Fermi liquid domains, we have sketched the transition of temperature and Fermi energy dependency of electron thermodynamics for graphene and other cases. An equivalent transition for quark matter is also discussed. The most exciting part is the general expression of specific heat, whose Fermi to Dirac fluid domain transition can be realized as a transition from a solid-based to a fluid-based picture. This understanding may be connected to the experimentally observed Wiedemann-Franz Law violation in the Dirac fluid domain of graphene system."

Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that stars with negative Ricci scalar $\\mathcal{R}$ are rather common and about $\\sim 50\\%$ of our EOSs produce one or more stars with Ricci curvature that is negative somewhere inside the star. The negative curvature is found mostly but not exclusively at the highest densities and pressures, and predominantly for stiff EOSs and for the most compact and most massive stars. Furthermore, we improve the quasi-universal relation between the stellar gravitational mass $M$ and the baryonic mass $M_\\mathrm{b}$, which allows us to express analytically one in terms of the other with a maximum variance of only $\\sim 3\\%$. Finally, using the relation between the Ricci scalar and the trace anomaly $\\Delta$, we determine the conditions under which $\\Delta$ vanishes or becomes negative in neutron stars."

Following years of development and refinement, continuum and lattice Schwinger function methods have recently joined in revealing the three pillars that support this emergent hadron mass (EHM); namely, a nonzero gluon mass-scale, a process-independent effective charge, and dressed-quarks with running masses that take constituent-like values at infrared momenta. One may argue that EHM and confinement are inextricably linked; and theory is now working to expose their manifold expressions in hadron observables and highlight the types of measurements that can be made in order to validate the paradigm. This contribution sketches these ideas via the unified explanation of pion and proton electromagnetic and gravitational form factors."

C 113, L012201] for locating the QCD critical point using constant-entropy contours by testing it against various effective QCD approaches. We demonstrate that, while the method yields spurious critical points in purely hadronic models (HRG) due to non-parabolic contour behavior at low temperatures ($T \\lesssim 120$ MeV), it accurately reproduces the CP location in frameworks that feature a genuine phase transition and benchmarked against lattice QCD, such as Holographic Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton, and Functional QCD approaches. Building on our previous determination of constant entropy contours using lattice data, we extend that analysis to construct a complete Lattice-based Equation of State (EoS) at finite density, which features a critical point at $(T, \\mu_B) \\approx (114, 602)$ MeV. By integrating the extrapolated entropy density with respect to temperature, we reconstruct the pressure, baryon density, susceptibility, and speed of sound in the critical region, and analyze the focusing behavior of isentropic trajectories in the vicinity of the critical point."

Here we show that the charge-weak form factor difference in $^{48}$Ca, recently extracted in a model-independent manner by the CREX experiment, exhibits strong sensitivity to the isovector spin-orbit interaction. Using Skyrme-like energy density functionals, we demonstrate that a significantly enhanced isovector spin-orbit interaction, about four times stronger than conventional parametrizations, can resolve the PREX-CREX puzzle, which has challenged modern nuclear theories and our understanding of nuclear symmetry energy, while maintaining a good description of nuclear bulk properties and well-established shell structure of finite nuclei. This enhanced isovector spin-orbit interaction also provides a novel mechanism for the emergence of the $N = 14$, $16$, $32$ and $34$ magic numbers in neutron-rich nuclei on the mean-field level. These findings point to a strong isospin dependence of the nucleon spin-orbit interaction, which is expected to have important implications for nuclear structures, electroweak nuclear processes, and related problems in nuclear astrophysics."

      "summary": "Higgs self-coupling is crucial to understand the structure of the scalar potential and the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. In this study, we utilize a deep neural network based on a particle Transformer model that relies on an attention mechanism to comprehensively analyze the measured trilinear Higgs self-coupling through Higgs pair production with subsequent decay into four b-quarks ( ) at the LHC. The model processes the full event-level information as input and bypasses explicit jet pairing. It also serves as an event classifier. At HL-LHC, our approach constrains to at 68% CL, and thus achieved an improvement of ~44% in precision over conventional cut-based analyses. The results of a comparison against alternative machine learning architectures demonstrate the outstanding performance of the Transformer-based model owing to its ability to capture correlations in high-dimensional collision data with the help of the attention mechanism. These findings highlight the potential of attention-based networks and end-to-end event classifiers in collider phenomenology."

      "summary": "One-loop contributions for the decay process within the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (THDM) are computed in the general gauge, and its phenomenological applications at future muon–TeV colliders are investigated. Analytic results are confirmed by several consistency tests, including those of ξ-independence, renormalization-scale stability, and the ultraviolet finiteness of the one-loop amplitude. We first perform an updated parameter scan of the Type-X THDM in phenomenological studies. The production of charged Higgs boson pairs at future muon–TeV colliders is then investigated through two processes: and . Both signal events and their significance are evaluated considering the corresponding Standard Model backgrounds. We find that the signal significances can exceed at several benchmark points in the viable parameter space of the Type-X THDM."

      "summary": "Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is a fundamental theory describing quark interactions. Thus far, various quark models based on QCD have been widely used to study the properties of hadrons, including their structures and mass spectra. However, unlike quantum electrodynamics and Bohr's model of the hydrogen atom, a direct classical analogy is lacking for hadronic structures. This paper presents a classical interpretation of the nonrelativistic quark potential model, providing a more intuitive and visualizable description of strong interactions through the quantitative formulation of color charge and color flux. In addition, we establish the relationship between meson mass and its structural radius in the nonrelativistic framework and estimate key parameters of our model using available data from and . Subsequently, we extend this relationship to a broader range of excited meson states and obtain their structural radii, which show good agreement with the root mean square radius or charge radius predicted by QCD calculations."

      "summary": "Neutrino oscillation experiments have confirmed that neutrinos are massive particles and that lepton flavors are mixed. To explain the observed lepton mass spectra and flavor mixing patterns, flavor symmetry plays a crucial and unique role. In this paper, we propose a useful symmetry-breaking scheme by applying within both charged-lepton and neutrino sectors at the mass-matrix level. For the three distinct residual subgroups , , and that are under consideration, we systematically analyze the various parameterizations of the lepton mass matrices. It is shown that all three scenarios are in good agreement with current neutrino oscillation data. Notably, within the latest best-fit values of neutrino oscillation parameters, the predicted values of the Dirac CP-violating phase δ are , , and , respectively. To further assess the viability of the model, a comprehensive numerical analysis is performed by utilizing neutrino oscillation parameters at the level. It is found that the allowed ranges of δ are , , and , which all fall within its range. These results indicate that the proposed symmetry-breaking scheme can naturally explain the realistic lepton mass hierarchy and mixing pattern, thereby providing valuable theoretical perspectives for future research."
