      "summary": "arXiv:2510.22194v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We study the effect of medium on radioactive alpha decay and other similar decays. The initial state in these type of decays is a quasi-bound state with energy greater than zero. Such a state has very large amplitude in the nuclear region and is exponentially suppressed at larger distances. The decay rate of such states is known to decrease rapidly with decrease in the Q-value. Here we study such a decay within a medium. We assume a simple spherically symmetric repulsive potential model for the medium. This models the cumulative effect of all nuclei in the medium which at short distances present repulsive Coulomb interaction. We find that as the Q-value becomes very small, the medium effects lead to a substantial enhancement in rate. In contrast, for large Q-values, the medium effects are negligible. We briefly comment on application to real systems and the experimental implications of this result."

Nuclei around A = 100 display complex shape evolution and configuration crossing patterns. We utilized the experimental and algebraic frameworks of the interacting boson model and the newly developed interacting boson-fermion model to study the isotopes of Mo and Ru. The results show significant variations in these quantities across nuclei located at the E(5) and X(5) critical points, analyzed through different observables. We also examined another region that is suitable for a shape phase transition. Furthermore, our findings suggest new candidates for critical points in other phase transitional regions for different isotopic chains."

This state is unique as its decay is dominated by a slow electric hexadecapole $E4$ transition, while the typically much faster electric quadrupole $E2$ decay path is energetically forbidden. We investigate the microscopic origin of this phenomenon by examining in detail the structure of the wave functions of the initial and final states, and the $E4$ transition matrix elements. This analysis of $^{93}$Mo is contrasted with that of its particle-hole conjugate, $^{99}$Cd, where such an $E4$ transition is absent."

The SOURCES code is a common tool for calculating the yield and spectrum of such neutrons. This paper critically examines all modelling assumptions and nuclear data in SOURCES and proposes alternative approaches where applicable. For $(\\alpha, n)$ reactions, we show that the alpha emission lines for $^{235}\\mathrm{U}$ should be updated. Furthermore, we compare four different stopping power data sets for alpha particles slowing down and propose measurements to constrain mixed oxide nuclear fuel data. We use the computer code PHITS to show that energy and angular straggling during the slowing down of alpha particles in the material of interest is unimportant. Then, we compare the cross section and emission spectrum of $(\\alpha, n)$ reactions in SOURCES to recently evaluated data libraries. Importantly, the modelling of SOURCES for the emission spectrum seems too simple and may need to be updated. Finally, we compare data on spontaneous fission and show that while the neutron yield from SOURCES is reliable, some discrepancy is found with the neutron spectrum of evaluated data libraries. Complementing this work is an implementation of spontaneous fission in the Monte Carlo code OpenMC."

However, traditional hybrid models, which combine hydrodynamics and hadronic transport, are computationally intensive, creating a significant bottleneck. In this work, we introduce DiffHIC, an end-to-end generative diffusion model, to emulate ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The model takes initial entropy density profiles and transport coefficients as input and directly generates two-dimensional final-state particle spectra. Our results demonstrate that DiffHIC achieves a computational speedup of approximately $10^5$ against traditional simulations, while accurately reproducing a wide range of physical observables, including integrated and differential anisotropic flow, multi-particle correlations, and momentum fluctuations. This framework provides a powerful and efficient tool for phenomenological studies in the high-precision era of heavy-ion physics."

While the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem formally guarantees the existence of an orbital-free density functional that is capable of describing all many-body effects, including shell effects, practical attempts since the 1970s have consistently failed to capture such effects. This persistent difficulty has even led to the misconception that the orbital-free DFT is inherently unable to describe nuclear shell effects. Here we develop a {\\it non-local} orbital-free DFT approach for atomic nuclei and demonstrate that nuclear shell effects can be successfully incorporated into the orbital-free DFT through the construction of a non-local kinetic energy density functional. In particular, we show that the non-local orbital-free functional yields a nucleon localization function that, as an established indicator of shell effects, exhibits consistent behavior with the exact Kohn-Sham solution."

Here we focus on the $B/Q\\times Z/A$ ratio, which can strongly depend on rapidity although its value is one for the full phase space. We find that this ratio is very sensitive to the difference between strange and anti-strange rapidity distributions (the $s-\\bar s$ asymmetry), and slightly more anti-strange quarks at mid-rapidity would lead to a ratio well below one. This is the case for Zr+Zr and Ru+Ru isobar collisions at $200A$ GeV from a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model. Without the $s-\\bar s$ asymmetry, the AMPT model would give a mid-rapidity $B/Q\\times Z/A$ ratio at or above one. In addition, the AMPT model gives $B/\\Delta Q\\times \\Delta Z/A<1$ at mid-rapidity for isobar collisions at all centralities, which strongly contradicts the recent data from the STAR Collaboration. We further find that the $B/\\Delta Q\\times \\Delta Z/A$ ratio is very sensitive to the net-light quark ($u,d$) stoppings, but it is less sensitive to the $s-\\bar s$ asymmetry than the $B/Q\\times Z/A$ ratio by a factor of 3."

A major challenge in the field is formulating a self-consistent description of the source function, final-state interactions between the particle pair, and interactions inherent to the source itself. To address this, we have developed a novel Monte Carlo model for calculating two-particle correlation functions in a classic framework. The model incorporates self-consistently the emission source of thermal equilibrium and three-body final state interactions. Application of the model shows satisfactory fit to experimental data, revealing that the correlation function is highly sensitive to the source's spatio-temporal extent. In contrast, the temperature parameter governing the emitted particles' energy spectra has a negligible influence. Our approach offers the potential to extract the spatio-temporal information from the emission source, thereby advancing the applicability of femtoscopic interferometry in the Fermi energy domain."

At beam energies up to 1.5AGeV, strangeness production can probe the equation of state for densities up to approximately twice nuclear saturation. In this paper we will discuss the possibilities of extending this range in density by the study of multi-strange baryons as well as charmed hadrons in the SIS100 beam energy range up to 10AGeV. Here, densities up to five times nuclear saturation can be reached and the production of multi-strange and charmed hadrons shows a strong sensitivity to the equation of state. On the other hand a precise prediction of the effect of the equation of state will require knowledge of the fundamental production cross section near the elementary production threshold in p+p collisions which is yet not measured for the hadrons discussed."

Quarkyonic stars occupy a distinct region (high central $c_s^2$ and positive $\\frac{dR}{dM}$) from purely nucleonic stars. This could be tested by future radius measurements of two stars of different mass.

We outline future prospects in the heavy-ion context, where HF-NRevo can serve as a baseline for modeling in-medium modifications of heavy-flavor fragmentation in nuclear collisions. Its accurate modeling of the partonic hierarchy and threshold effects makes it ideally suited to explore jet-quenching sensitivity, energy-loss mechanisms, and the emergence of medium-modified fragmentation functions in the quark-gluon plasma. Moreover, it provides a natural baseline for implementing in-medium hadronization scenarios, including quarkonium regeneration and fragmentation-function apparent-shape distortion. These developments provide new handles for exploring heavy-flavor dynamics at the HL-LHC and future collider facilities."

Supported by entanglement, they cannot be removed by local unitary operations, thus providing basis-independent measures, and sufficiently large values underpin the need for quantum computers in order to perform precise simulations of the system at scale. Towards a better understanding of the quantum-complexity generation by fundamental interactions, the building blocks of many-body systems, we consider non-local magic and anti-flatness in two-particle scattering processes, specifically focusing on low-energy nucleon-nucleon scattering and high-energy Moller scattering. We find that the non-local magic induced in both interactions is four times the anti-flatness (which is found to be true for any two-qubit wavefunction), and verify the relation between the Clifford-averaged anti-flatness and total magic. For these processes, the anti-flatness is a more experimentally accessible quantity as it can be determined from one of the final-state particles, and does not require spin correlations. While the MOLLER experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility does not include final-state spin measurements, the results presented here may add motivation to consider their future inclusion."

This, however, requires calculations of the EOS for a prohibitively large number of nuclear Hamiltonians, solving the nuclear many-body problem for each one. Quantum Monte Carlo methods, such as auxiliary-field diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC), provide precise and accurate results for the neutron matter EOS, but they are very computationally expensive, making them unsuitable for the fast evaluations necessary for uncertainty propagation. Here, we employ parametric matrix models to develop fast emulators for AFDMC calculations of neutron matter and use them to directly propagate uncertainties of coupling constants in the Hamiltonian to the EOS. As these uncertainties include estimates of the effective field theory truncation uncertainty, this approach provides robust uncertainty estimates for use in astrophysical data analyses. This Letter will enable novel applications such as using astrophysical observations to put constraints on coupling constants for nuclear interactions."

To this aim, we perform {\\it ab initio} quantum Monte Carlo calculations using two- and three-nucleon interactions derived in chiral effective field theory up to third expansion order. We show that the longest-range three-nucleon force stemming from the two-pion exchange plays a crucial role in the proper description of the neutron-$\\alpha$ $D$-wave phase shifts. Our Letter reveals the predictive power of chiral symmetry in the few-body sector and opens a new direction for probing and constraining three-nucleon forces."

Applying analogies, we establish a system to discuss the associations and equivalence relations among QCD, QED, and various (mixed) gauge field theory based quantum many-body effective models. By employing mathematical techniques on the background spacetime, these relations are extended to extreme regimes while ensuring model independence."

      "summary": "The evolution of shape in finite nuclei shows tremendous changes in nuclear structure properties within the nuclear Segre chart. The neutron-rich nuclei around mass A ∼ 100 are important due to the changing behavior of nuclear shapes across isotopic chains. We have investigated the ground state bulk properties of nuclei for N(Z) = 38, 40 and 42 isotonic(isotopic) series within the covariant density functional theory using the DD-ME2 (finite range) and DD-PC1 (zero range) interactions. A search for the shell closure at and around N(Z) ∼ 40 has been done in the chosen isotopic and isotonic series. The impact of shape evolution or deformation on nuclear charge radii and the surface properties has been analyzed in the mass region of about 70 ∼ 100. The surface properties such as the symmetry energy, neutron pressure, and symmetry energy curvature have been studied using the coherent density fluctuation model. The study gives the correlation of symmetry energy and its coefficients with the nuclear quadrupole deformation. On ignoring the effects of shape evolution, a good correlation of the surface properties can be obtained with the neutron skin-thickness of nuclei. N(Z) = 40 is found to behave as a magic number in the Z(N) = 40 and 42 series, and N(Z) = 38 as a deformed magic in Z(N) = 38 series only. In addition, a deformed magic behavior is obtained at N = 58 across all the isotopic series corresponding to both DD-ME2 and DD-PC1 interactions. While the magicity of N = 70 is suggested by DD-ME2 interaction. The symmetry energy of nuclei is changed by an amount of 1–2 MeV on varying the quadrupole deformation."
