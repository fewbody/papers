Heavy quarks acquire elliptic flow through strong coupling with the medium, making $v_2$ a sensitive observable for probing the hadronization time. In this Letter, we study the production and elliptic flow of $D_s$ and $D^0$ mesons in $Pb+Pb$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$~TeV within a Langevin dynamics framework for heavy quarks in the QCD medium, combined with the sequential or simultaneous coalescence plus fragmentation at the hadronization hypersurface. We find that, within the sequential hadronization framework, the earlier-produced $D_s$ exhibits a smaller $v_2$ than the $D^0$ in the intermediate $ p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ region. This reversed ordering behavior aligns with preliminary ALICE measurements and provides strong evidence for the heavy flavor sequential hadronization mechanism."

The calculation is performed in nuclear matter by solving the Bethe-Goldstone equation with the realistic Granada 2013 nucleon-nucleon potential, including both one-body and two-body meson-exchange currents (MEC) of seagull, pion-in-flight, and $\\Delta$ types. We find that MEC produce a sizable enhancement of the transverse response in the 1p1h channel when acting on correlated nucleon pairs with high-momentum components generated by SRC. This contrasts with the uncorrelated case, where MEC, dominated by the $\\Delta$ current, can even yield a negative effect. The results are consistent with previous findings based on the correlated basis function approach, supporting the interpretation that SRC play a central role in the transverse response enhancement from MEC."

The MCSM results with the modified Hamiltonian nicely predict the shape coexistence of $^{78}$Ni, consistent with recent experimental data. The evolution of intrinsic shapes from the spherical shape to prolate shapes in the ground state of $N=50$ nuclei is discussed using the \"T-plot\" and effective single-particle energies, which visualize the intrinsic quadrupole deformation of the MCSM wave function.

Furthermore, considering $\\alpha$ decay energies derived from three mass models, namely the Weizsacker-Skyrme-4 (WS4) mass model, the relativistic continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov theory mass model, and the FRDM (2012), we extend this model to predict the $\\alpha$ -decay half-lives of Z = 118 and 120 isotopes.

We found that the shell effect is obvious at N = 178 and at N = 184 in the WS4 mass model and FRDM(2012), while the shell effect is only obvious at N = 184 in the relativistic continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov theory mass model."

Within the high-energy limit, the photon emission rate and the associated electromagnetic energy loss are derived using the Gyulassy-Levai-Vitev formalism at first order in opacity, for a quark jet traversing a quark-gluon plasma under a background magnetic field. Quantitative analysis shows a slight suppression of the overall photon radiation over a broad range of jet energies as the jet propagates through the medium. This reduction in photon yield consequently leads to a moderate decrease in the electromagnetic energy loss of the jet. These results contribute to a better understanding of the electromagnetic properties of strongly interacting matter in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions and motivate an experimental comparison of photon yields from Quark-Gluon Plasma with similar properties but distinct magnetic field strengths."

To achieve this goal, we employ a set of equations of state based on a parameterization of the covariant density functional theory of nuclear matter that allows controlled variations of $L_{\\rm sym}$ and the skewness $Q_{\\rm sat}$, holding the latter fixed. For a set of our simulations, we identify a steep energy gradient in the equation of state at subsaturation densities, which acts as a source of heating with subsequent stiffening produced by thermal support. Accounting for related structural modifications in the tidal deformability reconciles our results with theoretical expectations. On the other hand, we show that gravitational waves are unlikely to distinguish the role of $L_{\\rm sym}$. In contrast to this, we find that the ejecta composition is significantly altered in our simulations, which employ an M1 moment scheme, when $L_{\\rm sym}$ is varied. Based on our extracted dynamical ejecta properties, we compute r-process yields and find that they are distinct for the different $L_{\\rm sym}$, especially at lower mass numbers $A \\lesssim 120$. This suggests that electromagnetic counterparts are more likely to exhibit signatures; however, a direct connection to $L_{\\rm sym}$ remains a challenge, given the complex interplay between details of the ejecta properties and the kilonova signal."

Focusing on the conformal case in 1+1 dimensions, we numerically solve the equations of motion for two classes of consistent initial data and assess the robustness of the resulting solutions with respect to changing the hydrodynamic frame. Our flux-conservative formulation does not exhibit spurious oscillatory structures within the regime of validity of BDNK theory (the hydrodynamic-frame-robust regime), corresponding to sufficiently small Knudsen numbers. Using this flux-conservative approach, we numerically investigate the potential formation of shocks and their fate in BDNK in 1+1D using smooth initial data known to produce shocks in the relativistic Euler equations. For the type of initial data we consider, we show that the sharp features formed in Euler are prevented by the hyperbolic viscous BDNK equations. The prevention of shock formation we observe occurs in the frame-robust regime of BDNK. This, however, does not preclude the formation of shocks in BDNK for different smooth initial data. The reliability of our results is supported by systematic numerical convergence testing, which is used to assess shock indicators, simulation performance, and the robustness of solutions for different hydrodynamic frames."

Using these developments, I discuss results from a first exploration of the ensuing stopping and equilibration dynamics of heavy quarks in a strongly coupled environment. The second direction is the transport of quarkonia, bound states of heavy quarks, where novel Generalized Gluon Distributions have been recently defined and calculated in the framework of potential non-relativistic QCD. I discuss their application to the dynamics of quarkonium in heavy-ion collisions, highlighting the need to account for non-Markovian effects in the interactions between the heavy quark pair and quark-gluon plasma -- which have thus far resisted a systematic characterization."

The latter serves to preserve the gauge invariance of the hadronic amplitudes and becomes trivial in light-cone gauge. Therefore, the calculation of the distribution amplitudes simplifies significantly provided that wave functions and propagators are obtained in that gauge. In here, we explore the corresponding Dyson-Schwinger equation in its leading truncation and with a dressed vertex derived from a Ward identity in light-cone gauge. The quark's mass and wave renormalization functions, as well as a third complex-valued amplitude, are found to depend on the relative orientation of the quark momentum and a light-like four-vector, which expresses a geometric gauge dependence of the propagator."
