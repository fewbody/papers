This method has been successfully applied to quarkonium production in box simulations and in heavy-ion collisions. In this study this method is extended to strongly bound states with considerable binding energies by taking into account the potential energy between heavy quark pairs in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). We find that an attractive heavy-quark potential enhances quarkonium production and the results are consistent with those from the statistical model in box simulations, if a proper spatial cutoff is introduced to the potential to mimic quantum effects."

This hybrid approach effciently derives analytical expressions by leveraging the smoothed predictions of optimized ML models, a significant acceleration over direct symbolic regression on raw experimental data.\n  We apply this framework, as an example, to nuclear charge radii across the nuclear chart, notably including light nuclei that are often excluded from such studies. We employ Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models to map correlations between charge radii and key physical features: mass $A^{1/3}$ and proton number $Z^{1/3}$ dependencies, total binding energy, and for the first time, the pairing gap. Our models are rigorously trained using four-fold cross-validation with automated hyperparameter optimization, ensuring robustness and generalizability, which is critical for the typically small and skewed datasets in nuclear physics. Finally, we distill the knowledge from the initial LGBM and GPR models into simplified, interpretable mathematical expressions via symbolic regression, white-boxing these ML models. The derived formulas provide physical insights comparable to traditional many-body models and demonstrate a powerful pathway for physics expression discovery guided by ML."

      "summary": "arXiv:2512.07111v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: I present a direct boundary matching method (DBMM) for solving nuclear scattering problems using Lagrange-Legendre basis functions. This approach belongs to the family of bound-state techniques for the continuum, reformulating scattering problems into a localized, square-integrable ($L^2$) representation. The key feature is the direct incorporation of the outgoing wave boundary condition into the last row of the matrix equation, eliminating the need for Bloch operators and two-step matching procedures required in traditional R-matrix methods. Unlike the complex scaling method that rotates coordinates into the complex plane, DBMM operates entirely in real coordinate space. The formalism is extended to coupled-channel problems, where the wave function decomposition naturally leads to an effective source potential that distinguishes between the entrance channel and other channels. Benchmark calculations for p~+~$^{12}$C scattering demonstrate excellent agreement with the Numerov integration method."

We find that the critical temperature of the non-interacting system vanishes due to the fact that the system is quasi-one-dimensional, indicating that non-interacting bosons cannot undergo Bose-Einstein condensation. For interacting bosons, we investigate a system with quartic self-interaction. We show that the order parameter vanishes and the off-diagonal long-range order is absent at any nonzero temperature because of the quasi-one-dimensional feature, in accordance with the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg theorem."

In this work, we employ the Gamow shell model (GSM) to investigate the structure and decay of $^{20}$Si, a candidate for six-proton (6$p$) emission, which can be produced via two-neutron knockout from the drip line nucleus $^{22}$Si. We predict that its ground state decays via $6p$ emission to the ground state of $^{14}$O, with a decay energy $E_{6p} = 10.125$ MeV and a width of 371~keV. A $2^+$ state is predicted at 1.7 MeV, comparable with that in $^{18}$Mg, indicating the disappearance of the $Z=14$ magic number in $^{20}$Si. Instead, analyses of the many-body configurations and the average occupancies of the mirror states suggest the presence of $dynamic$ TES in low-lying states of $^{19}$Al/$^{19}$C and $^{20}$Si/$^{20}$C. Further evidence is provided by analyzing the contributions of different components of the GSM Hamiltonian. Moreover, this study offers the first theoretical description of $^{20}$Si and guidance for future experiments."

Our calculation is built on the proton triangle diagram with an effective Yukawa $\\pi^0$-proton coupling, offering an alternative to quark-level descriptions that is advantageous when the magnetic length greatly exceeds the proton size. Corrections to the pion decay constant are computed up to second order in the magnetic field strength, revealing that the field generally suppresses the decay rate. Quantitatively, however, the effect remains modest even for fields as strong as $|eB|\\simeq m_\\pi^2$. The differential photon emission rate exhibits anisotropy, with the strongest suppression occurring when the pion momentum is perpendicular to the magnetic field. Overall, the modification of the $\\pi^0 \\to \\gamma\\gamma$ rate is parametrically small, scaling as $|eB|^2/m_P^4$, where $m_P$ is the proton mass. Nevertheless, under favorable conditions, the resulting angular anisotropy could lead to observable signatures in heavy-ion collisions."

Using a symmetry-driven cotangent-bundle approach, we show that the isometry group of each slicing acts on phase space in such a way that only its Casimir invariants and the time-like coordinate unconstrained, so the distribution function depends solely on these quantities. This yields a unified boost-invariant exact solution of the Boltzmann equation valid for each constant-curvature foliation of \\ds. Specializing this general solution to the flat and spherical foliations reproduces the Bjorken and Gubser flows, respectively, while its restriction to the hyperbolic foliation produces a genuinely new analytic solution (`Grozdanov flow'). Hydrodynamics and free streaming emerge naturally as limiting regimes of this novel exact solution. We further comment on several relevant aspects of the new boost-invariant solution on the hyperbolic slicing and on their interpretation once mapped back to Minkowski space."

We clarify that the relativistic 3D axial charge distribution in the Breit frame is completely described by the induced pseudotensor form factor $G_T^Z(Q^2)$ rather than by the axial form factor $G_A^Z(Q^2)$. We demonstrate that $R_A \\equiv \\sqrt{ \\frac{-6}{G_A^Z(0) }\\frac{\\text{d} G_A^Z(Q^2) }{\\text{d} Q^2} \\Big|_{Q^2=0} }$ can not be interpreted as the physically meaningful 3D root-mean-square axial radius of a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ hadron. The genuine axial radius for any spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ hadron in fact does not exist.

This feature enables a unified treatment of hadronic matter across vacuum, nuclear and dense astrophysical regimes. This compact review summarizes the key structures of parity-doublet Lagrangians; outlines the mean-field formulation for nuclear and stellar matter; and highlights recent phenomenological and lattice constraints on the chirally-invariant mass. Emphasis is placed on mirror versus na\\\"ive chiral assignments; the role of vector interactions in achieving nuclear saturation; and the implications of parity doubling for the equation-of-state of dense matter and neutron-star cooling. The review concludes with current theoretical challenges and perspectives for extending these models beyond the mean-field approximation."

Allowing temperature dependent masses for the fermions, we show that above a critical temperature $T_c$ the quark mass has to drop rapidly in order to obtain energy density values compatible with the Lattice-QCD results. Within this framework, thus, the restoration of chiral symmetry in the system is observed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the gluon variance -- which is a fundamental quantity of the NAQPM -- is strongly correlated to the fermion mass and decreases by orders of magnitude through the transition. The high temperature phenomenological characteristics of the gluon appear consistent to properties of the perturbative QCD gluon. The model indicates that color deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration are interrelated and classical configurations of the QCD dynamics play an important role to the criticality of the system."

For non-perturbative systems, for instance nuclear physics, this requires the non-perturbative treatment of at least part of the interaction (or the potential, if one is dealing with a non-relativistic system), while the rest of the interaction is included as perturbations. This is not entirely trivial and as a consequence different interpretations on how to treat these systems have appeared. A practical approach is to expand the effective potential, where this potential is later fully iterated in the Schroedinger equation for obtaining amplitudes and observables. The expectation is that this will lead to observables that will have an implicit power counting expansion. Here I explicitly check whether the amplitudes (when expanded according to the counting) are actually following the same power counting as the potential. It happens that reality does not necessarily conform to expectations and the amplitudes will sometimes violate the power counting with which the potential has been expanded. A more formal approach is to formulate the expansion directly in terms of amplitudes and observables, which is the original aim of the effective field theory idea. Yet this second approach is technically complicated. I explore here the possibility of constructing potentials that when fully iterated will make sure that amplitudes are indeed expansible in terms of a small expansion parameter."
