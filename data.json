The GOE-$S$-matrix model does not require any experimental values of the average level spacing $D$ and average decay width $\\Gamma$ with their statistical distributions, but the model is fully characterized by the channel transmission coefficients used in the Hauser-Feshbach theory. We demonstrate that the obtained compound nucleus decay width distribution resembles the $\\chi$-squared distribution with the degree of freedom greater than unity. This approach enables us to generate fluctuating cross sections while preserving requisite unitarity and accounting for interference between resonances. By comparing the calculated cross section distribution with that from $R$-matrix theory, we demonstrate a smooth transition from the resolved resonance region to the continuum region."

These give the next highest weight (nhw) irrep, next-to-next highest irrep (nnhw) and so on. Recently, it is shown that for nuclei with $32 \\le \\mbox{Z,N} \\le 46$, there will be not only proxy-$SU(3)$ but also proxy-$SU(4)$ symmetry [Kota and Sahu, Physica Scripta {\\bf 99}, 065306 (2024)]. Following these developments, presented in this paper are the $SU(3)$ irreps $(\\lambda ,\\mu)$ with $2\\lambda + \\mu =2\\lambda_H + \\mu_H-3r$, $r=0,1,2$ for various isotopes of Ge, Se, Kr, Sr, Zr, Mo, Ru and Pd (with $32 \\le \\mbox{N} \\le 46$) assuming good proxy-$SU(4)$ symmetry. A simple method for obtaining the SU(3) irreps is described and applied. The tabulations for proxy-$SU(3)$ irreps provided in this paper will be useful in further investigations of triaxial shapes in these nuclei."

When such fluctuations are modeled naively in relativistic systems, strange features can appear such as negative self-correlation functions. We construct an effective theory for nonlinear stochastic relativistic hydrodynamics that ensure a well-posed mathematical formulation. Using Crooks fluctuation theorem, we derive a symmetry of the effective action that incorporates fluctuations through a suitable free energy functional. For divergence type theories, the action can then be fully specified using a single vector generating current. The equations of motion obtained using this procedure are guaranteed to be flux conservative and symmetric hyperbolic when the dynamics is causal. This ensures that these equations are well-posed (for suitable initial data) and are in a form that can easily be simulated, including with Metropolis techniques."

Different choices for defining the hyperonic couplings with different levels of parametric freedom are discussed. In all models, the predicted NS maximum masses are reduced compared with the purely nucleonic composition as expected. In the case of relating hyperonic couplings via $SU(6)$-symmetry arguments to the nucleonic ones, we find that NS radii for intermediate mass stars are shifted to higher values compared with purely nucleonic stars, in agreement with the existing literature. However, allowing for more freedom for the hyperonic couplings, the effect is strongly reduced, and the distributions in the NS mass-radius plane of models with and without hyperons become very close. We have also investigated how different nucleonic density functionals influence the hyperon matter composition and neutron star properties."

      "summary": "arXiv:2510.00114v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Initial states of dense matter with nonzero electron chiral imbalance could potentially give rise to strong magnetic fields through chiral plasma instability. Previous work indicated that unless chiral chemical potential is as large as the electron vector chemical potential, the growth of magnetic fields due to the instability is washed out by chirality flipping rate enabled by electron mass. We re-examine this claim in a broader range of parameters and find that at higher temperatures the hierarchy is reversed supporting a growing magnetic field for an initial electron chiral chemical potential much smaller than the electron vector chemical potential. Further, we identify a qualitatively new effect relevant for magnetized hot and dense medium where chiral magnetic effect (CME) sourced by density fluctuation acts as a powerful source of Joule heating. Remarkably, even modest chiral chemical potentials (keV) in such environment can deposit energy densities set by the QCD scale in a relatively short time of the order of a few milliseconds or seconds. We speculate how this mechanism makes CME-driven Joule heating a potentially critical ingredient in the dynamics of turbulent density fluctuation of supernovae and neutron star mergers."

      "summary": "arXiv:2510.00252v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We provide some critical remarks on the recently proposed two-component parametrization of nuclear parton distribution functions, which was motivated by the apparent correlation between the nuclear modifications of structure functions and nucleon-nucleon short-range correlation phenomena. This parametrization, we show, is invariant under a rescaling transformation of the involved abundance coefficients, which means that the global normalization of these coefficients cannot be meaningfully determined in a fit, and only their ratios should be studied for finding evidence of short-range-correlation type behavior at parton level. As we show, however, the current constraints for the nuclear-mass dependence of these coefficients allow also for interpretations different from short-range correlations. Nevertheless, this two-component parametrization exhibits a similar scaling relation for DIS structure functions as demonstrated in earlier works, and, as we demonstrate, yields testable predictions for structure-function and hard-process cross-section ratios. We also note on the non-trivial isospin dependence of the short-range-correlation motivated parametrization, which under proton-neutron pair dominance assumption can lead to charge-symmetry-violation resembling terms."

Historically, any new discovery about the proton has fuelled advances in several scientific fields. We have reported that gluons inside the proton accumulate near the critical momentum due to chaotic phenomena, forming gluon condensation. Surprisingly, the pion distribution predicted by this gluon distribution for the production of high-energy proton collisions could answer two puzzles in astronomy and high-energy physics. We find that during ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray collisions, gluon condensation may abruptly produce a large number of low-momentum pions, whose electromagnetic decays have the typical breakout properties appearing in various cosmic gamma-ray spectra. On the other hand, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is well below the cosmic ray energy scale, also shows weak but recognisable signs of gluon condensation, which had been mistaken for BEC pions. The connection between these two phenomena, which occur at different scales in the Universe, supports the existence of a new structure within the proton-gluon condensation."

This includes a discussion of approximations in relation to complex bosonic fields and the Silver-Blaze property. The resulting flow equation for the scale-dependent effective potential can in principle be solved down to the infrared limit. For our quark-diquark model, which may serve as a low-energy model for dense strong-interaction matter, we find that a competition between the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer singularity and bosonic fluctuations can trigger a first-order phase transition at low temperatures that turns into a second-order phase transition at a tricritical point as the temperature increases."

Using the Thermal-FIST package, thermal parameters extracted from fits to various sets of hadron yields, including and excluding light nuclei, are used to calculate the ratios of the yields of light nuclei, namely, $d/p$, $\\bar{d}/\\bar{p}$, $t/p$, and $t/d$. A comparison with data from the STAR and ALICE collaborations shows that a sequential freeze-out scenario provides a better description of light nuclei yield ratios than the traditional single freeze-out approach. These results suggest the flavour-dependent chemical freeze-out for final state light-nuclei production persists in heavy-ion collisions at both RHIC and LHC energies."

      "summary": "The isotopic ratios measured in meteoritic presolar grains are a crucial tool for tracing the nucleosynthetic origin of isotopes. In the case of silicon isotopes, two important indicators to establish the origin of presolar grains are the ratios 29Si/28Si and 30Si/28Si. To constrain theoretical predictions, the rates of key nuclear reactions influencing the abundances of 29Si and 30Si must be well known. One such reaction is 29Si(p,γ)30P which plays a role in classical nova explosions. The aim of the present work is to determine the nonresonant cross section of the 29Si(p,γ)30P reaction, which has not been previously measured. The activation method was employed to measure the total cross section at four proton energies between Ep = 1000 and 1430 keV. The measured cross sections were found to be significantly (a factor of 4.3 ± 0.6) higher than those predicted by theoretical direct capture calculations, thereby impacting the reaction rates at low astrophysical temperatures, below about 30 MK. This higher nonresonant cross section—now based on experimental data—can be used in forthcoming nucleosynthesis calculations of classical novae. As a secondary result, the 16O(p,γ)17F cross section was also obtained and found to be in good agreement with existing literature data."

The Hamiltonian contains Song and Lin potential with a constant term dependent on radial and orbital quantum numbers. The Gaussian wave function used has a dependence on radial distance r, radial quantum number n, orbital quantum number l and a trial parameter $$\\mu $$. The obtained spectra of D and $$D_s$$ mesons are in good agreement with other theoretical models and available experimental masses. The mass spectra of D and $$D_s$$ mesons are also used to plot Regge trajectories in the (J, $$M^2$$) and ($$n_r$$, $$M^2$$) planes. In (J, $$M^2$$) plane, both natural and unnatural parity states of D and $$D_s$$ mesons are plotted. The trajectories are parallel and equidistant from each other. The two-body strong decays of D and $$D_s$$ are analyzed in the framework of heavy quark effective theory using computed masses. The strong decay widths are given in terms of strong coupling constants. These couplings are also estimated by comparing them with available experimental values for observed states. Also, the partial decay width ratios of different states are analyzed and used to suggest assignments to the observed states.
