By analyzing nuclear bulk properties, binding energy, charge radii, two-neutron separation energies, deformation parameters ($\\beta_2$), and single-particle levels we trace the evolution of magic numbers. Our results highlight the single-particle energy levels to examine nuclear shell closure and the occupancy of individual nucleon orbitals. A comprehensive picture of N = 34 shell closure is particularly prominent in the isotopic chains of Cl, Ar, and Ti nuclei, where the magicity associated with this number remains evident across several isotopes. In contrast, the N = 40 exhibits a more robust and widespread manifestation across all the examined nuclei, indicating that its shell closure is less sensitive to the specific isotopic environment and more universally applicable across the given nuclear systems. To further validate these closures, we apply the coherent density fluctuation model (CDFM) to assess isospin-dependent observables, such as the symmetry energy and its surface and volume components. A systematic analysis of the symmetry energy, computed using the relativistic mean-field (RMF) approach, maps the evolution of the shell structure at $N = 20$ and 28, supports sub-magicity at $N = 34$, and strongly suggests a shell closure at $N = 40$, reflected consistently in both bulk and surface properties. The interplay between shell structure and nuclear deformation remains a central topic of research, and future theoretical and experimental studies will continue to shed light on the complex behaviour of these fascinating systems."

By systematically exploring parameter spaces and comparing theoretical predictions with recent observational constraints, we establish constraints on the chiral invariant mass. Our results suggest that more than a half of the nucleon mass originates from sources beyond spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, challenging conventional understanding of nucleon mass generation. These constraints arise solely from fundamental physical principles and observational data, independent of specific assumptions about the nature of the quark-hadron transition, providing robust insights into the microscopic origin of hadron masses."

      "summary": "arXiv:2508.00306v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We have investigated the role of isospin asymmetry of the $NN$ effective interaction in the context of $NA$ elastic scattering. To this purpose we represent the {\\it in-medium} $g$ matrix as an admixture of isospin-symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter solutions of Brueckner-Hartree-Fock equations for infinite nuclear matter, denoted as $g[\\rho,\\beta]$. We use the Argonne $v_{18}$ bare potential to represent the $NN$ interaction in free space, due to its ability to describe the $NN$ scattering amplitudes up to 350 MeV. The density-dependent isospin-asymmetric $g$ matrices are then used to calculate optical model potentials for elastic nucleon scattering off closed-shell nuclei. For this aim, we make use of the Arellano-Bauge $\\delta g$-folding approach suited for an explicit treatment of nonlocal density matrices. This approach allows to account for the local isospin-asymmetry and density dependence of the {\\it in-medium} $NN$ interaction. The resulting optical potentials are nonlocal since the entire nonlocal structure of the $g$ matrix is retained. We observe that including the isospin asymmetry in the $g$ matrix allows for a reasonable description of differential cross-sections at nucleon beam energies between 40 and 200 MeV. In the case of proton scattering at energies below $\\sim$65 MeV, at momentum transfers $q$ below $\\sim$1 fm$^{-1}$, the inclusion of neutronic-matter $g$ matrices yields better agreement with the data as compared to the case when symmetric nuclear matter $g$ matrices are used. These results provide evidence that the isospin-asymmetry in the $NN$ effective interaction yield non-negligible effects in nucleon scattering off isospin-asymmetric targets at beam energies below 65 MeV."

In the electric basis, Hilbert space fragmentation has recently been shown to limit the excitation of large electric fields. Here, we leverage this to develop a formalism for estimating the size of truncation errors in the electric basis. Generically, the truncation error falls off as a factorial of the field truncation. Examples of this formalism are applied to the Schwinger model and a pure U(1) lattice gauge theory. For reasonable choices of parameters, we improve on previous error estimates by a factor of 10^{306}."

While recent studies have explored neural-network-based variational methods for scalar field theory in position space, a systematic benchmark of the analytically solvable Klein-Gordon ground state -- particularly in the momentum-space field basis -- has been lacking. In this work, we represent the ground-state wavefunctional as a neural network defined on a discretized set of field configurations and train it by minimizing the Hamiltonian expectation value. This framework enables direct comparison to exact analytic results for a range of key observables, including the ground-state energy, two-point correlators, expectation value of the field, and the structure of the learned wavefunctional itself. Our results provide quantitative diagnostics of accuracy and demonstrate the suitability of momentum space for benchmarking neural network approaches, while establishing a foundation for future extensions to interacting models and position-space formulations."

These evolution equations are written in the large-$N_c\\&amp;N_f$ limit and are double-logarithmic, resumming powers of $\\alpha_s\\ln^2(1/x)$. Here $N_c$ and $N_f$ are the numbers of quark colors and flavors, while $\\alpha_s$ is the strong coupling constant and $x$ is the Bjorken-$x$ variable. Using our solution, we obtain analytic expressions for the flavor singlet quark and gluon helicity parton distribution functions (PDFs) and for the $g_1$ structure function as double-inverse Laplace transforms. We also extract analytic expressions for the four DGLAP polarized anomalous dimensions $\\Delta \\gamma_{qq}, \\Delta \\gamma_{qG}, \\Delta \\gamma_{Gq}$, and $\\Delta \\gamma_{GG}$: these expressions resum powers of $\\alpha_s/\\omega^2$ to all orders at large-$N_c\\&amp;N_f$ (with $\\omega$ the Mellin moment variable).

We find that all our predictions for polarized DGLAP anomalous dimensions are fully consistent with the existing finite-order calculations.

In the context of high-temperature quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, thermoelectric responses can provide insight into the evolving microscopic dynamics and the redistribution of effective degrees of freedom across the phase transition region. In this work, for the first time, we present a phenomenological study of the thermoelectric figure of merit (\\( ZT \\)) in hot QCD matter, with a particular focus on its behavior across the hadronic and quark-gluon plasma phases. Using model-based calculations for the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity, we analyze the temperature dependence of \\( ZT \\) and identify characteristic features near the QCD phase transition temperature. Our results indicate that \\( ZT \\) exhibits nontrivial behavior near the transition region, reflecting the changing transport properties and active degrees of freedom in the medium. This phenomenological study of the thermoelectric figure of merit provides a complementary perspective to traditional transport studies and may provide critical insights for advancing the understanding of QCD matter through the transition region."

Our analysis is based on a hybrid equation of state (EoS) with a phase transition from hypernuclear matter to color-superconducting quark matter, where both phases are described within a relativistic density functional approach. By varying the vector meson and diquark couplings in the quark matter phase, we obtain different hybrid star sequences with varying extension of the quark matter core, ensuring consistency with astrophysical constraints from mass, radius and tidal deformability measurements. As a result, we demonstrate the impact of an increasing rotational frequency on the maximum gravitational mass, the central energy density of compact stars, the appearance of the quasi-radial oscillations and non-axisymmetric instabilities. We demonstrate that for the most favorable parameter sets with a strong vector coupling, hybrid star configurations with color superconducting quark matter core can describe the fastest spinning and heaviest galactic neutron star (NS) J0952-0607, while it is out of reach for the purely hadronic hypernuclear star configuration. We also revise the previously proposed empirical relation between the Kepler frequency, gravitational mass, and radius of non-rotating NSs, obtained based on the assumption that all NSs, up to the heaviest, are hadronic. We show how the phase transition to quark matter alters this relation and, consequently, the constraints on the dense matter EoS. Our findings reveal that incorporating the hybrid EoS has significant implications for the constraints on the properties of strongly interacting matter and NSs, placing the upper limit on $R_{1.4} \\leq 14.90$ km and $R_{0.7}<11.49$ km (considering 716 Hz frequency limit from J1748+2446ad) and $R_{1.4}\\leq$11.90~km (for 1000 Hz)."
