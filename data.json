The Langevin code developed by the authors reproduces the fragment mass and total kinetic energy distributions with remarkable accuracy for the reactions 36Ar + 144Sm ⇒ 180Hg and 36Ar + 154Sm ⇒ 190Hg at various excitation energies, with deviations of the calculated results from experiment that do not exceed the experimental uncertainties. The study also clarifies the role of shell effects due to multi-chance fission at excitation energies of 30–50 MeV, where these effects are not well known. The present work confirms the five-dimensional Langevin approach as a reliable tool to predict fission process observables.[Phys. Rev. C 111, 054620] Published Tue May 20, 2025"

In this work, I connect the weak-interaction-driven bulk viscosity in neutron-proton-electron ($npe$) matter to the symmetry parameters by calculating the susceptibilities of dense matter in terms of the symmetry energy. I use this result to calculate the resonant-peak value of the bulk viscosity as a function of density, finding that it strongly depends on $L$, as does the minimum bulk-viscous dissipation timescale. Also resulting from this calculation is a formula for finding the conformal points of the zero-temperature equation of state. Finally, I determine for which values of the symmetry parameters the maximum r-mode stable rotation frequency of an $npe$-matter neutron star is smaller than the Kepler frequency, in the high-temperature conditions where bulk viscosity is the dominant dissipation mechanism."

Specifically, we show that the fluctuations of harmonic flow can be probed by the factorization-breaking coefficients between flow vectors in different $p_T$-bins. Experimental difficulty can be reduced by taking one of the flow vectors momentum averaged. Fluctuations cause a decorrelation between the flow vectors, which can be attributed to equal contributions from the flow magnitude and flow angle decorrelation. We study fluctuations of mean transverse momentum per particle ($[p_T]$) in ultra-central collisions and show that our model can explain the steep fall of its variance observed by the ATLAS collaboration. We also present robust predictions for the skewness and kurtosis, and highlight the role of impact parameter fluctuations in ultracentral collisions. We study the Pearson correlation coefficients between $[p_T]$ and $v_n^2$, which can map the initial state correlations between the shape and size of the fireball. We show that higher order normalized and symmetric cumulants between these observables can be constructed, which put useful additional constraints on the initial state properties. Furthermore, we study the momentum dependent Pearson correlation between $[p_T]$ and the transverse momentum dependent flow. It shows sensitivity to the Gaussian width of the nucleon at the initial state. Finally, we show that such correlations and fluctuations of collective observables can be used to study nuclear deformation and put robust constraints on their deformation parameters through high energy nuclear collisions."

Specifically, the multi-nucleon correlation functions have been under intense experimental and theoretical investigation in the recent years. Due to the interest of using this observable as an input in the construction of potentials between hadrons we revisit the nucleon-nucleon correlation function and calculate it using different nuclear interactions at high precision. Since the nucleon-nucleon potential is determined to reproduce the two-nucleon scattering data, we would like to critically evaluate the amount of this information captured by the correlation function. We study the dependence of the correlations on the nuclear force giving detailed insights into the calculations, in particular the convergence behavior in the partial waves. The coupling between the different partial-wave channels is taken into account and the relevance of this effect is quantified. To make contact with precedent studies the results based on the Argonne V18 interaction are presented. Then we consider also the Norfolk NV2-IIa and NV2-IIb chiral EFT interactions. The analysis of the differences between the correlations of the various interactions shows that for momenta between 0 and 500 MeV there are variations of up to 5.9 % for the $nn$ system, of up to 1.8 % for the $np$ system, and of 1.4 % for the $pp$ system."

Comparing different experimental $\\beta$-shapes to each other and to those predicted by theory in a consistent manner is difficult. This difficulty is compounded when different parameterizations of the $\\beta$-shape function are used. Usually some form of a power polynomial of the total electron energy is chosen for this parametrization. This choice results in extracted coefficients that are highly correlated, with their physical meaning and numerical value dependent on the order of polynomial chosen. This is true for both theoretical and experimental coefficients, and leads to challenges when comparing coefficients from polynomials of different orders. Accurately representing the highly correlated uncertainties is difficult and subtle. These issues impact the underlying physical interpretation of shape function parameters. We suggest an alternative approach based on orthogonal polynomials. Orthogonal polynomials offer more stable coefficient extraction which is less dependent on the order of the polynomial, allow for easier comparison between theory and experimental coefficients from polynomials of different orders, and offer some observations on simple physical meaning and on the statistical limits of the extracted coefficients."

The strength appears at greater than $\\sim$2~MeV above the single-neutron decay threshold and has been identified as arising from transfer into the neutron $0d_{3/2}$ orbital.

The deuteron wave function consists of both a singlet-singlet color state and additional hidden color states arising from non-trivial color rearrangements. Our results reveal that while the singlet-singlet state is present, the hidden color states collectively dominate, contributing a larger probability to the deuteron wave function.

We develop a framework to compute the quark-antiquark-gluon component of the pion, starting from its valence light-front wave function. Additionally, the quark and gluon parton distribution functions (PDFs) are derived by considering this higher Fock component in the pion state. The proposed operator, which acts on the valence state to produce the quark-antiquark-gluon component of the pion, is tested against results from BLFQ for its contribution to the quark and gluon PDFs, as well as with results from the BSE. In the BLFQ framework, we identify the effect of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking on the pion structure through the enhancement of the spin-flip matrix element. This enhancement is captured in the $|q\\bar{q}g\\rangle$ component of the light-front wave function and the associated gluon PDF. We explicitly demonstrate an enhancement of the low-$x$ contribution in the quark PDF, which is associated with the large spin-flip matrix element, which also drives the $\\pi-\\rho$ mass splitting. The proposed framework also enables an exploration of the effect of the dressed gluon mass for a given valence state at the pion scale.

The derived eigenvalue equation is then solved non-perturbatively to obtain the wave functions, which are then used to compute the current matrix element.\n  We perform a covariant analysis of the current matrix element taking into account possible violation of the Poincar\\'e symmetry due to the Fock sector truncation. The physical form factor depends on two boost invariants $\\zeta, \\Delta^2_\\perp$, instead of the single Lorentz invariant $Q^2$. Instead of adopting the conventional Drell-Yan frame $\\zeta = 0$, we evaluate the form factor in general frames, and use the frame dependence to quantitatively gauge the loss of the Lorentz covariance. Our numerical result shows that as more Fock sectors are included, the frame dependence reduces dramatically. In particular, the anti-nucleon degree of freedom plays an important role in the reduction of the frame dependence, even though it only takes a small portion within the state vector. We also find that there is no zero-mode contribution to the current for the scalar Yukawa theory."

The lattice calculations are performed using HISQ action with physical strange quark mass and light quark masses twenty times smaller than the strange quark mass at two lattice spacings $a=0.0493$ fm and $0.0602$ fm, and temporal extents $N_{\\tau}=16-30$, corresponding to the temperatures $T=133-250$ MeV. We use a tadpole-improved NRQCD action including spin-dependent $v^6$ corrections for the heavy quarks and extended meson operators in order to be sensitive to in-medium properties of the bottomonium states of interest. We find that within estimated errors the bottomonium masses do not change compared to their vacuum values for all temperatures under our consideration; however, we find different nonzero widths for the various bottomonium states."

      "summary": "We study the possibility of obtaining the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics as an effective theory of a more fundamental one, whose electroweak sector includes two non-universal local U(1) gauge groups, with the chiral anomaly cancellation taking place through an interplay among families. As a result of the spontaneous symmetry breaking, a massive gauge boson arises, which couples differently to the third family of fermions (by assumption, we restrict ourselves to the scenario in which the couples in the same way to the first two families). Two Higgs doublets and one scalar singlet are necessary to generate the SM fermion masses and break the gauge symmetries. We show that in our model, the flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) of the Higgs sector are identically zero if each right-handed SM fermion is only coupled with a single Higgs doublet. This result represents a FCNC cancellation mechanism different from the usual procedure in Two-Higgs Doublet Models. The non-universal nature of our solutions Requires the presence of three right-handed neutrino fields, one for each family. Our model generates all elements of the Dirac mass matrix for quarks and leptons, which is quite non-trivial for non-universal models. Thus, we can fit all the masses and mixing angles with two scalar doublets. Finally, we show the distribution of solutions for the scalar boson masses in our model by scanning well-motivated intervals for the model parameters. We consider two possibilities for the scalar potential and compare these results with the Higgs-like resonant signals recently reported by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC. Finally, we also report collider, electroweak, and flavor constraints on the model parameters."

A finite field strength that is consistent with previous estimates of the magnetic field in heavy-ion collisions can be used to xplain the experimentally observed Lambda local spin polarization through all centrality classes. Moreover, the weak magnetic effect plays an unambiguous role in the ordering between the second-order and third-order modulations of experimental Lambda local spin polarization."

By analyzing the null geodesics, we derive the photon sphere, event horizon, effective potential, and critical impact parameters. We then employ a ray-tracing technique to study the trajectories of photons surrounding a thin accretion disk. Three different emission models are considered to explore the observed intensity profiles of direct rings, lensing rings, and photon sphere. By comparing these results with those of the standard Reissner-Nordström black hole ( ) and the Kalb-Ramond black hole with different values of the Lorentz-violating parameter (specifically, and ), we find that Lorentz symmetry breaking leads to a decrease in the radii of the photon sphere, event horizon, and innermost stable circular orbit. Consequently, the detection of these black holes is more challenging."

The studied effect is expressed as a shift in the anisotropic angular distribution of γ-rays emitted by excited fission fragments by a small angle relative to the deformation axis of the fissile nucleus when the neutron beam polarization direction is reversed. All measurements were performed at the Heinz Mayer-Leibniz research neutron source (FRM II reactor) of the Munich Technical University in Garching on the polarized neutron beam of the POLI instrument. To generalize all results obtained on ROT effects for fission γ-rays, the results of earlier studies by the ITEP group for cold neutrons are re-processed, and the result obtained by the PNPI group for thermal neutrons is also presented."

Based on this idea, in this work we investigate the phase structure and stability of Einstein-Power-Yang-Mills (EPYM) AdS black holes in the restricted phase space, assuming the black hole event horizon has a fractal structure. From the first law of thermodynamics for EPYM AdS black holes in the restricted phase space, we find that the mass parameter should be interpreted as the internal energy. Moreover, the Smarr relation for this system in the restricted phase space is not a homogeneous function due to the fractal structure, which differs significantly from the corresponding relation in the extended phase space. The presence of a fractal structure can be regarded as a probe for phase transitions. Interestingly, for a fixed central charge in the EPYM AdS black hole system with a fractal structure, a supercritical phase transition also exists, similar to the case in the standard EPYM AdS black hole system. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of the fractal parameter ∆ and non-linear Yang-Mills parameter γ on the thermodynamical stability of this system are also investigated."

Monte Carlo simulations for studying the yields of photonuclear reactions were performed using Geant4 and TALYS-2.0 codes. The obtained experimental results were compared with available literature data and calculated results. The comparison showed that the values of the relative reaction yield and flux-averaged cross-section coincide with the literature data, considering the different geometries of the experiments.

      "summary": "Quasars serve as important cosmological probes; constructing accurate luminosity relations for them is essential for their use in cosmology. If the coefficients of such luminosity relations vary with redshift, they could introduce biases into cosmological constraints derived from quasars. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of the redshift variation in the X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity ( - ) relations of quasars. For the standard - relation, we show that the relation coefficients exhibit a strong and linear correlation with redshift that is not attributable to the selection effect. Additionally, we examine two three-dimensional, redshift-evolving - relations and show that the inclusion of a redshift-dependent term does not eliminate the impact of redshift evolution, given that the relation coefficients continue to evolve with redshift. Finally, we construct a new - relation in which the redshift evolution of the relation coefficients is nearly eliminated. By calibrating the luminosity relations using Hubble parameter measurements, we demonstrate that quasars based on the proposed relation yield effective constraints on cosmological parameters that are consistent with results from Planck CMB data, unlike constraints derived from the standard relation."

These results are consistent with measurements from various other methods. Furthermore, through correlation analysis between the neutron skin thickness and nuclear symmetry energy slope parameter L, we determined the symmetry energy slope coefficients to be MeV (SLy4) and MeV (SLy7) based on the scattering data.
