Nevertheless, the development of a comprehensive approach to such a problem remains challenging, particularly at the relativistic electron-energy scale. Herein, we present a theoretical approach to investigate the impact of electron polarization in scattering off unoriented light nuclei, based on the multipole expansion for the scattering cross section at high energies. Numerical calculations for stable $^{6,7}$Li and unstable $^{7}$Be nuclei show that the longitudinal polarization and weak interaction are not explicitly correlated when electrons scatter at 0$^{\\circ}$ for all energy scales. In contrast, their correlation is strongly exhibited at other scattering angles when energy exceeds 10 GeV. A comparison between stable and unstable nuclei reveals that the stability of nuclei significantly affects the electron polarization contribution to the scattering cross section. This study opens new approaches to the nuclear structure problems, in particular the EMC effect, via the deep inelastic electron-nucleus scattering using the unified electroweak theory."

      "summary": "arXiv:2507.10752v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The thermodynamic properties of an ideal bosonic system composed of particles and antiparticles at finite temperatures are examined within the framework of a scalar field model. It is assumed that particle-antiparticle pair creation occurs; however, the system is simultaneously subject to exact charge (isospin) conservation. To implement this constraint, we first consider the system within the Grand Canonical Ensemble and then transform to the Canonical Ensemble using a Legendre transformation. This procedure provides a formally consistent scheme for incorporating the chemical potential at the microscopic level into the Canonical Ensemble framework. To enforce exact conservation of charge (isospin, N_I), we further analyze the thermodynamic properties of the system within the extended Canonical Ensemble, in which the chemical potential becomes a thermodynamic function of the temperature and conserved charge. It is shown that as the temperature decreases, the system undergoes a second-order phase transition to a Bose-Einstein condensate at the critical temperature T_c, but only when the conserved charge is finite, N_I=const \\ne 0. In a particle-antiparticle system, the condensate forms exclusively in the component with the dominant particle number density, which determines the excess charge. We demonstrate that the symmetry breaking of the ground state at T=0 results from a first-order phase transition associated with the formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate. Although the transition involves symmetry breaking, it is not spontaneous in the strict field-theoretic sense, but is instead induced by the external injection of particles. Potential experimental signals of Bose-Einstein condensation of pions produced in high-energy nuclear collisions are briefly discussed."

We use updated constraints on the mass, radius, and tidal deformability of neutron star (NS) objects and pulsars to examine nuclear equations of state (EOS) based on realistic finite-range M3Y nucleon-nucleon interaction, which have been successfully used to describe low- and high-dense nuclear matter (NM). We then employ these EOSs to examine the impact of tidal deformability and compactness of NSs on their structure. We found that the EOSs from CDM3Y-230 to CDM3Y-330 characterized with the saturation incompressibility ${K}_{0}=230-330$ MeV together yield more limited ranges of tidal deformability and radius for NS objects than their experimentally inferred ranges. For light NS ($M<\\text{M}_{\\odot}$), both ${k}_{2}$ and $\\mathcal{C}$ decreases upon decreasing the NS mass, which enhances its tidal deformability. The stiffness of the NS core matter has shown a minor effect on the tidal deformability of such NS ($M\\text{M}_{\\odot}$), upon increasing (decreasing) the stiffness of the employed EOS (its mass). This appears as enhanced tidal deformability indicated at a larger radius for NS of stiffer NM and for the lighter NS above $\\text{M}_{\\odot}$. Unified description of some correlations between tidal deformability, tidal Love number, and NS compactness is provided independent of the details of the considered EOS."

Our study demonstrates that SQM objects can efficiently convert mechanical energy into hadronic energy due to the critical mass density at their surfaces of 4.7*10^{14} g/cm^3, below which SQM becomes unstable and decays into photons, hadrons, and leptons. We show that even small-amplitude radial oscillations, with a radius change of as little as 0.1%, can result in significant excitation energies near the surface of SQM stars. This excitation energy is rapidly converted into electromagnetic energy over short timescales approximately 1 ms, potentially leading to observable astrophysical phenomena. Higher amplitude oscillations may cause fragmentation or dissolution of SQM stars, which has important implications for the evolution of binary systems containing SQM objects and the emission of gravitational waves."

We explore their binding characteristics and interaction dynamics by examining the energy separation between the dibaryon states and the corresponding two-baryon thresholds. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of single-flavor dibaryon states as a function of the quark masses.

Assuming a simple model for such coupling under the approximation of spherical symmetry, a phenomenological scaling formula for the maximum mass of stars is derived as a function of the surface magnetic field and the strange quark mass. This formula is applicable for all formally admissible values of the free parameters, and strict scaling with the bag constant is retained only for a vanishing strange quark mass.\n  As a byproduct of this study, the mathematical structure of the equation of state for the relativistic SQM model with a massive strange quark is revisited without approximations. It is observed that the contribution of the electron term to the energy density cannot be neglected in the theoretical limit of large strange quark masses. Consequently, the maximum mass of SQM stars increases with sufficiently large strange quark mass, contrasting with the behavior observed for low strange quark masses."

This mechanism provides a portal between the dark sector and visible matter. In this study, we present a procedure to derive theoretical upper bounds on the kinetic mixing parameter $\\varepsilon^2(M_U)$ by analyzing dilepton spectra from heavy-ion collisions across a broad energy range, from SIS to LHC energies. Our analysis is based on the microscopic Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach, which successfully reproduces the measured dilepton spectra in $p+p$, $p+A$, and $A+A$ collisions across the same energy range. Besides the dilepton channels resulting from interactions and decays of Standard Model particles (such as mesons and baryons), the PHSD has been extended to include the decay of hypothetical dark photons into dileptons, $U \\to e^+ e^-$. The production of these dark photons occurs via Dalitz decays of $\\pi^0$, $\\eta$, $\\omega$, $\\eta^{\\prime}$, and $\\Delta$ resonances; direct decays of $\\rho$, $\\omega$, and $\\phi$; the kaon mode $K^+ \\to \\pi^+ U$; and thermal $q\\bar q$ annihilation in the quark-gluon plasma. Our results show that high-precision measurements of dilepton spectra in heavy-ion collisions provide a sensitive and competitive probe of dark photons in the MeV to multi-GeV mass range. Furthermore, we quantify the experimental accuracy required to constrain the remaining viable parameter space of kinetic mixing in dark photon scenarios."

In this work, we operate directly with the non-diagonal mass matrix and employ a quantum field theory approach to describe neutrino oscillations within the plane-wave approximation, circumventing the use of wave packets. Within this framework, numerical estimates for the amplitude of a local process involving lepton interactions via virtual neutrino exchange yield values of order $10^{-53}$.
