      "summary": "A recent study from the LHCb detector analyzed the $$J/\\psi \\eta $$ mass spectrum from $$B^+\\rightarrow J/\\psi \\eta K^+$$ decays, reporting the branching fraction ratios as $$F_{X}\\equiv \\frac{\\mathcal {B}r(B^+\\rightarrow \\psi ' K^+)\\times \\mathcal {B}r(\\psi '\\rightarrow J/\\psi \\eta )}{\\mathcal {B}r(B^+\\rightarrow \\psi (2S) K^+)\\times \\mathcal {B}r(\\psi (2S)\\rightarrow J/\\psi \\eta )}$$ for $$\\psi '=\\psi _2(3823),\\psi (4040)$$, which are $$(5.95^{+3.38}_{-2.55})\\times 10^{-2}$$ and $$(40.60\\pm 11.20)\\times 10^{-2}$$, respectively. Also, the products related to $$B_{X}\\equiv \\mathcal {B}r(B^+\\rightarrow \\psi 'K^+)\\times \\mathcal {B}r(\\psi '\\rightarrow J/\\psi \\eta )$$ branching fractions are $$B_{\\psi _2(3823)}=(1.25^{+0.71}_{-0.53}\\pm 0.04)\\times 10^{-6}$$ and $$B_{\\psi (4040)}=(8.53\\pm 2.35\\pm 0.30)\\times 10^{-6}$$. This represents the first calculation of this branching fraction using factorization. Our calculations indicate that $$F_X$$ is $$F_{\\psi _{2}(3823)}=(6.55\\pm 1.88)\\times 10^{-2}$$ and $$F_{\\psi (4040)}=(14.33\\pm 4.15)\\times 10^{-2}$$ at $$\\mu =m_b/2$$. We have estimated $$B_{\\psi _{2}(3823)}=(0.26\\pm 0.05)\\times 10^{-6}$$ at $$\\mu =m_b/2$$ and $$B_{\\psi (4040)}=(2.88\\pm 0.64)\\times 10^{-6}$$ at $$\\mu =2m_b$$."

      "summary": "It is shown that the quantum Hamiltonian characterising a non-relativistic electron under the influence of an external spherical symmetric electromagnetic potential exhibits a supersymmetric structure. Both cases, spherical symmetric scalar potentials and spherical symmetric vector potentials are discussed in detail. The current approach, which includes the spin-$$\\frac{1}{2}$$ degree of freedom, provides new insights to known models like the radial harmonic oscillator and the Coulomb problem. We also find a few new exactly solvable models, one of them exhibiting a new mixed type of shape invariance containing translation and scaling of potential parameters. The fundamental role as Witten parity played by the spin-orbit operator is high-lighted."
