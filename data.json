VivianiThe 4He nucleus, for historical reasons often called the α particle, has a large binding energy but it lacks stable excited states. Experimental data suggest a 0+ resonance about 0.4 MeV above the p-3H threshold with a width comparable to that energy. The authors carry out a benchmark calculation which locates a shallow bound excited state in 4He near that threshold when they switch off the Coulomb interaction. As they gradually re-introduce it, the excited state crosses the threshold and eventually becomes a resonant state. Comparisons of resonant energy and width show significant discrepancies with R-matrix analyses from experimental data. However, using universal concepts, the authors conclude that the existence of this state is not a consequence of a particular interaction between the constituent protons and neutrons but is due to a discrete scale invariance that constrains the spectrum of the N-body system, thus demonstrating a connection to the universal behavior of systems with four nucleons.[Phys.

The calculations successfully reproduce the excitation energies and deformations of known high-$K$ isomers in the nuclei from $^{175}$Tm to $^{181}$Re. For the nuclei closer to the $Z=82$ shell closure ($^{183}$Ir, $^{185}$Au, and $^{187}$Tl), predictions for the configurations of observed and yet-to-be-observed isomers are provided. The results reveal strong shape polarization, where the three-quasiparticle states are driven to larger deformations compared to the often shape-soft or spherical ground states. A particularly rich spectrum of shape coexistence is predicted in $^{187}$Tl, where several high-$K$ three-quasiparticle configurations with distinct prolate, oblate, and triaxial shapes are found to coexist at similar excitation energies. Notably, the oblate-deformed $K^{\\pi}=29/2^+$ configuration at $E_x = 1839$ keV is proposed to be responsible for a long-lived isomer. This study provides a comprehensive picture of shape evolution and coexistence in high-$K$ multi-quasiparticle states, offering valuable insights for future experimental research."

We present the first {\\em ab initio} calculations that simultaneously describe single- and double-$\\Lambda$ hypernuclei from the light to medium-mass range, the equation of state for $\\beta$-stable hypernuclear matter, and neutron star properties. Despite the formidable complexity of quantum Monte Carlo~(QMC) simulations with multiple baryonic degrees of freedom, by combining nuclear lattice effective field theory with a newly developed auxiliary-field QMC algorithm we achieve the first sign-problem free {\\em ab initio} QMC simulations of hypernuclear systems containing an arbitrary number of neutrons, protons, and $\\Lambda$ hyperons, including all relevant two- and three-body interactions. This eliminates reliance on the symmetry-energy approximation, long used to interpolate between symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter. Our unified calculations reproduce hyperon separation energies, yield a neutron star maximum mass consistent with observations, predict tidal deformabilities compatible with gravitational-wave measurements, and give a trace anomaly in line with Bayesian constraints. By bridging the physics of finite hypernuclei and infinite hypernuclear matter within a single {\\em ab initio} framework, this work establishes a direct microscopic link between hypernuclear structure, dense matter composition, and the astrophysical properties of neutron stars."

Here, we ask whether spin could already be present in the initial condition of the collisions. In particular, we argue that if a spin density exists at the beginning of the QGP expansion, it should experience event-by-event fluctuations due to the finite number of participant nucleons. In this contribution, we propose a simple model of fluctuating spin initial conditions for event-by-event spin hydrodynamics based on the Glauber Monte Carlo paradigm. We postulate that, if the net spin of the events is conserved from the initial to the final state, then initial state fluctuations of spin should manifest in specific spin correlations of $\\Lambda$ hyperons. Within our picture, we predict that this signal is much larger in central O+O collisions than in central Pb+Pb collisions."

By tagging the blocked quasiparticles with single-particle states of semi-magic dysprosium isotope, we efficiently calculated 22 prolate and 22 oblate states in each of the 154 nuclei, and we tracked them across the entire major neutron shell. We compared this extensive set of theoretical results with experimental data available for 82 states in the region. Breaking the rotational, time-reversal, and signature symmetries, we aligned the intrinsic angular momenta along the axis of axial symmetry, thereby enabling the full shape and spin self-consistent polarizations. The spectroscopic moments were then obtained by restoring the rotational symmetry. We conducted a detailed analysis of the pattern of agreement and disagreement between theory and experiment in individual nuclei. For the magnetic dipole moments, the agreement with data varies and is characterized by an overall average and RMS deviations of 0.11$\\mu_N$ and 0.35$\\mu_N$, respectively. For the electric quadrupole moments, a good corresponding agreement of 0.16b and 0.29b was observed."

For the chiral effective theory, we discuss the calculation of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of the nucleon at nonzero skewness, along with the corresponding gravitational (or mechanical) form factors, within the convolution framework. In the QED application, we extend the nonlocal formulation to construct the most general nonlocal QED interaction, in which both the propagator and fundamental QED vertex are modified due to the nonlocal Lagrangian, while preserving the Ward-Green-Takahashi identities. For consistency with the modified propagator, a solid quantization is proposed, and the nonlocal QED is applied to explain the lepton $g-2$ anomalies without the introduction of new particles or interactions. Finally, with an extension of the chiral effective action to curved spacetime, we investigate the nonlocal energy-momentum tensor and gravitational form factors of the nucleon with a nonlocal pion-nucleon interaction."

      "summary": "arXiv:2509.25838v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The possibility of neutron decay into dark particles has been proposed as a way to resolve a growing discrepancy between two different measurements of the neutron lifetime. The most popular formulation is a dark sector consisting of a dark baryon $\\chi$ and a dark scalar $\\phi$, where a neutron in vacuum decays about 1% of the time via the channel $n\\rightarrow \\chi+\\phi$. In this work, we consider the effect of this additional neutron decay channel on transport in neutrons star mergers. We find that the neutron dark decay rate in medium is quite slow, and thus the dark baryons modify the dense matter equation of state in a way that decreases the Urca bulk viscosity by, at most, a factor of 2-3. However, if the neutron dark decay was to occur more rapidly, then the bulk viscosity at merger temperatures of tens of MeV would be strongly enhanced, potentially rapidly damping oscillations in merger environments and therefore providing a signature of slowly equilibrating matter in the merger."

However, precise measurements of complete $\\beta$ decay spectra, particularly at low energies, remain experimentally and theoretically challenging. Here we report a high-precision, threshold-free measurement of the full $\\beta$ decay spectrum of 210Pb to excited states of 210Bi, using a transition-edge sensor (TES)-based micro-calorimeter. This approach enables the detection of $\\beta$ particle energies from 0 keV up to their endpoint by coincidence summing with subsequent de-excitation energy, thereby eliminating reconstruction artifacts near zero energy that have traditionally limited low-energy spectral accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first complete, high-precision $\\beta$ decay spectrum from 0 keV. The data resolve theoretical uncertainties associated with the atomic quantum exchange (AQE) effect. An accompanying ab initio theoretical framework, incorporating atomic, leptonic, and nuclear components, predicts a statistically significant (7.2 {$\\sigma$}) enhancement in $\\beta$ emission probability near zero energy, in agreement with the measurement and in contrast to models that omit AQE corrections. These results provide a new benchmark for $\\beta$ decay theory at low energies, deepen our understanding of the weak interaction, and establish a critical foundation for searches for new physics, including dark matter interactions and precision studies of neutrinos."

More recently, heavy-ion programs at RHIC and the LHC have offered a novel perspective on jets, establishing them as unique probes of strongly interacting matter. Experimental observations, including the suppression of high-$p_T$ hadrons and jets, provide compelling evidence for the formation of a new state of matter and its strong coupling to energetic partons.\n  These advances have motivated new theoretical approaches to jet quenching that go beyond standard perturbative techniques, aiming to elucidate the mechanisms of energy dissipation and thermalization of energetic partons in the quark-gluon plasma. This review highlights recent progress, beginning with a unified description of medium-induced radiation across the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal regime and its role in turbulent gluon cascades. We then examine radiative corrections that renormalize the transport coefficient $\\hat q$, the mechanism of color decoherence in multi-parton systems, and nonlinear QCD evolution equations for jet energy loss. Finally, we confront this framework with experimental measurements, underscoring the need for precision phenomenology to fully exploit the rich data sets from RHIC and the LHC."
