As archetypal examples of these challenges, we consider $^{11}$Li and $^{29}$F, well known halo nuclides situated on islands of inversion. The deformed intruder levels, which are primarily two-particle, two-hole neutron excitations with respect to naive spherical shell model configurations, are slow, with respect to increases of the model space, to take their rightful place as the lowest levels; in fact the spherical and deformed configurations likely mix strongly. We suggest these systems prototype the challenges for other important intruder states, and can serve as useful testbeds for potential approaches."

In this work, we constrain the equation of state (EoS) of nuclear matter - constructed within the framework of the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model - by combining results from chiral effective field theory and multimessenger observations of neutron stars. Using the saturation properties of nuclear matter, we generate a wide ensemble of EoS, which are subsequently constrained within a Bayesian framework. The resulting posterior distributions provide tight bounds on both the saturation parameters and the coupling constants of the RMF model. Our results indicate that the GW170817 event and the latest NICER observation favor a relatively soft EoS, leading to lower crust-core transition densities and thinner neutron star crusts. The radius of a $1.4\\,M_\\odot$ neutron star is tightly constrained to $12.508_{-0.241}^{+0.257}$ km, while the maximum mass reaches $2.174_{-0.123}^{+0.174}\\,M_\\odot$. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the $\\omega$-$\\rho$ coupling, which governs the density dependence of the symmetry energy, becomes increasingly significant under successive astrophysical constraints. Finally, the predicted neutron skin thickness of $^{48}$Ca agrees well with the CREX measurement, whereas that of $^{208}$Pb remains in tension with PREX-II. In contrast to earlier studies, we do not observe a clear correlation between the neutron skin thickness of $^{208}$Pb and the symmetry energy slope parameter $L$."

We extend our prior studies to third- and fourth-order cumulants in both coordinate- and momentum-space acceptances and integrated correlation functions (factorial cumulants). We find that, even near the critical point, non-Gaussian cumulants equilibrate on time scales comparable to those of the second-order cumulants, but show stronger finite-size effects. The presence of interactions and of the critical point leads to strong deviations of the cumulants from the ideal-gas baseline in coordinate space; these deviations are expected to persist in momentum space in the presence of collective expansion. In particular, the kurtosis becomes strongly negative, $\\kappa \\sigma^2 \\ll -1$, on the crossover side of the critical point. However, this signal is significantly diluted once an efficiency cut used to distinguish protons from baryons is applied, leading to $|\\kappa \\sigma^2| \\lesssim 1$ even in the presence of the critical point.

The nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for the $2\\nu$ECEC process in $^{132}$Ba and $^{78}$Kr have been calculated using the SN100PN and GWBXG effective interactions, respectively.

Two different formulations are employed to estimate the half-lives. We also examine the cumulative contribution of $1^+$ and $0^+$ states in the intermediate nuclei to the NMEs associated with the Gamow-Teller (GT) and Fermi transitions, respectively. Our results provide an improved prediction of the NME and half-life for $2\\nu$ECEC in $^{78}$Kr compared to previous studies and offer a precise theoretical benchmark for future experimental investigations in $^{132}$Ba."

We show that they provide similar results in the region where it is possible to evaluate the imaginary part of the energy for a resonant (Gamow) state. We then investigate the role of the centrifugal barrier induced by Coulomb interaction and also by proton single particle orbitals. We show that the so-called universal decay law, connecting the logarithm of the monopole reduced width to the fragmentation potential, remains also valid for beta-delayed proton emission processes. This fact allows us to describe experimental data for all proton emission processes in terms of a linear dependence connecting the logarithm of the monopole Coulomb-reduced decay width to the logarithm of the monopole Coulomb penetrability and fragmentation potential within a factor of three for absolute values."

Although hadron production in UrQMD does not occur on a sharp chemical freeze-out hyper-surface, the extracted fit quality is shown to be very good. The extracted chemical parameters depend on the selected hadron species as well as the underlying equation of state (EoS) of the matter. Including light nuclei and anti-protons in the fit increases the expected freeze-out temperature, while a stiffer EoS increases the obtained chemical potential. Similarly, the baryon densities extracted by the thermal fits depend on the choice of hadrons as well as the underlying equation of state. These results are important for the upcoming CBM@FAIR physics program and highlight that a degree of caution is advised when one relates the chemical freeze-out curve to features on the QCD phase diagram like the critical endpoint or a possible phase transition"

The present letter extends the exact thermal pairing plus phonon damping model to explore the microscopic nature of the UBR and its thermodynamic origin over a wide mass range of odd-odd, odd-A, and even-even systems, from $^{44}$Sc to $^{153}$Sm, whose experimental RSFs, including the UBRs, are available. The results of our calculations indicate that the UBR originates from non-collective particle-particle and hole-hole excitations with a strength three times stronger than that of the giant dipole resonance. Moreover, our results reveal that the UBR, which emerges only at finite temperatures within the present framework, invalidates the Brink-Axel hypothesis in the very low $E_\\gamma$ region. Last but not least, a global relation between the integrated strength of the RSF in the UBR region to that of the total RSF and the mass number is reported, for the first time, within the present study."

We explore two different reduced-basis method strategies: one based on the Kohn variational principle and another on Galerkin projections of the underlying system of linear equations. We use the adaptive greedy algorithm previously developed for two-body scattering for optimal selection of high-fidelity training points in the input parameter space. We demonstrate that these emulators reproduce ab initio hyperspherical harmonics calculations of $R$-matrix elements with remarkable precision, achieving relative errors as low as $10^{-7}$ with a small number of training points, even in regions of strong nonlinear parameter dependence. They also dramatically accelerate the exploration of the scattering predictions in the parameter space, a capability highly desired for calibrating (chiral) three-nucleon forces against scattering measurements. Our formalism can be further generalized to handle nucleon-deuteron scattering above the breakup threshold. These emulator developments will provide valuable tools to accelerate uncertainty quantification and rigorous parameter inference in the study of nuclear forces."

Axion effects (modeled via $\\theta\\equiv a/f_a$) stiffen the equation of state (EOS) of non-strange quark stars, increasing their maximum mass and radii, in agreement with multimessenger constraints from pulsar observations and gravitational wave events.

Their description in terms of the underlying quarks and gluons of the QCD Lagrangian remains a central challenge of modern physics. Colliders offer a unique opportunity to probe these phenomena experimentally: high energy partons produced from the QCD vacuum excite these emergent degrees, imprinting their dynamics in correlations in asymptotic energy flux. Decoding these correlations requires measurements with exceptional angular resolution, beyond that achieved in previous measurements. Recent progress has enabled precision calculations of energy flux on charged particles alone, allowing data-theory comparisons for measurements using high resolution tracking detectors. In this Letter, we resurrect thirty-year-old data from the ALEPH tracker, and perform a high angular resolution measurement of the two-point correlation of energy flux, probing QCD over three orders of magnitude in scale in a single measurement. Our measurement unveils for the first time the full spectrum of the correlator, including light-ray quasi-particle states, flux-tube excitations, and their transitions into confined hadrons. We compare our measurement with record precision theoretical predictions, achieving percent level agreement, and revealing interesting new phenomena in the confinement transitions.

Working in the gaugeless Hamiltonian formulation -- where the gauge field is exactly integrated out and no truncation of the electric flux is required -- we investigate scattering processes across sectors of fixed global baryon number $B = 0, 1, 2$. These correspond respectively to meson--meson, meson--baryon, and baryon--baryon collisions. At strong coupling, the $B = 0$ and $B = 2$ channels exhibit predominantly elastic dynamics closely resembling those of the U(1) Schwinger model. In contrast, the mixed $B = 1$ sector shows qualitatively new behavior: meson and baryon wave packets become entangled during the collision, and depending on their initial kinematics, the slower state becomes spatially delocalized while the faster one propagates ballistically. We characterize these processes through local observables, entanglement entropy, and the information-lattice, which together reveal how correlations build up and relax during the interaction. Our results establish a first benchmark for non-Abelian real-time scattering from first principles and open the path toward quantum-simulation studies of baryon-number dynamics and inelastic processes in gauge theories."

Our framework is also well suited for studying explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae. In this paper, we investigate 1D explosion models using the \"PUSH method\", focusing on progenitors with varying metallicities and initial masses around $M_\\mathrm{ZAMS} = 16 M_{\\odot}$. Detailed post-process nucleosynthesis calculations and Monte Carlo analyses are used to explore the effects of reaction rate uncertainties and to identify key reaction rates in explosive nucleosynthesis. We find that many reactions have little impact on the production of iron-group nuclei, as these elements are primarily synthesized in the nuclear statistical equilibrium. However, we identify a few \"key reactions\" that significantly influence the production of radioactive nuclei, which may affect astrophysical observables. In particular, for the production of ${}^{44}$Ti, we confirm that several traditionally studied nuclear reactions have a strong impact. However, determining a single reaction rate is insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion."

We employ the density-dependent relativistic mean-field model (DDME2) for the hadronic phase and the density-dependent quark mass (DDQM) model for the quark phase to construct hadronic and hybrid equations-of-state (EoSs) that are consistent with the astrophysical constraints. The presence of hyperons softens the EoS and with a phase transition, the EoS further softens, and the speed of sound squared drops to around 0.2 for the maximum mass configuration, which lies in the pure quark phase. Adjusting the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant, $\\alpha$, within its allowed range results in a decrease in the mass-radius relationship for negative $\\alpha$, and an increase for positive $\\alpha$. In addition, functions are fitted to the maximum mass and its associated radius as a function of the constant $\\alpha$ to observe its impact on these properties. We find that positive values of $\\alpha$ support massive stars consistent with the 2\\,$M_{\\odot}$ constraint and NICER measurements, while negative values, although compatible with low-mass radius observations, fail to reach the observed maximum mass, particularly for EoSs involving phase transitions. Therefore, astrophysical observations may be used to effectively constrain the allowed range of $\\alpha$."

The remaining free parameters are constrained by performing a global analysis to the available polarized small-$x$ deep inelastic scattering data. A good description of the world data is obtained with only 8 free parameters. The model parameters are tightly constrained by the data, allowing us to predict the proton polarized structure function $g_1^p$ to be negative at small $x$. Furthermore, we obtain the small-$x$ quark and gluon spins to give a contribution $\\int_{10^{-5}}^{0.1} dx \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta\\Sigma + \\Delta G \\right) = 0.76 \\pm 0.13$ or $1.70\\pm 0.20$ to the proton spin, depending on the applied running coupling prescription."

      "summary": "In this work, we investigate electron energy spectra and localization in a three-dimensional harmonium system using the shifted 1/N-expansion method. Our results show that increasing confinement strength $$\\upomega $$ raises energy levels and reduces equilibrium interelectron distances, as stronger confinement forces electrons into tighter spatial regions. In the strong-correlation limit $$\\upomega \\rightarrow 0$$, we confirm the formation of a Wigner molecule. Additionally, we establish the transition from the Wigner molecule regime to a strongly confined state where quantum confinement suppresses correlation effects. Our results further show that energy levels increase by increasing the principal quantum number (n), while centrifugal effects lead to a slight reduction in energy levels with increasing angular momentum number ($$\\ell )$$. These results enhance our understanding of electron correlation effects in confined quantum systems and have potential applications in nanophysics and quantum computing."

Most of them agree closely with experimental data. The wave functions of yrast , , , states and negative parity and states of these nuclei are discussed in detail.
