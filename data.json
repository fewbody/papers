      "summary": "arXiv:2506.03962v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The apparent production of (multi-)strange baryons and mesons at sub-threshold energies in proton-heavy ion collisions is a consequence of short range correlations (SRC), which have recently been observed in lepton-nucleus scattering. They may enhance the available center of mass energy of individual nucleon-nucleon collisions and allow, therefore, for sub-threshold particle production in proton-nucleus collisions. Calculations demonstrate that SRC enhance the probability for particle production at nominal sub-threshold energies up to a factor of $\\times 10^3$ as compared to a simple Fermi gas model. We benchmark the idea by calculating the $\\Xi^-$ multiplicity in nominal sub-threshold p+Nb collisions which compare well with the data measured by the HADES collaboration. These findings are of prime relevance for upcoming experiments at the FAIR facility, especially for the study of charmed hadrons."

      "summary": "arXiv:2506.04029v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In heavy ion collisions particle distributions fluctuate from event to event. It is interesting to study local fluctuations of a specific particle specie, e.g. baryons, in the transverse plane. Fluctuations of the harmonic flow provide an integrated measure of such fluctuations. An alternative approach is to study proton number fluctuations measured in a relatively narrow azimuthal angle window. Due to the transverse flow, particles registered in a narrow azimuthal angle window are emitted predominantly from a region of the fireball located at the same azimuthal angle. Similarly, it is informative to measure the covariance of the number of protons emitted in two opposite windows of azimuthal angles. The main difficulty lies in distinguishing effects of local baryon density fluctuations in the transverse plane from global particle density and collective flow fluctuations. These global volume and flow fluctuations can be estimated using some reference particles, e.g. charged mesons. Reliable estimates of such fluctuations can be constructed both for the second factorial cumulant of the proton number in an azimuthal angle window and for the covariance between two such windows. The simultaneous measurement of both quantities provides a sensitive probe of local baryon number fluctuations superimposed on top of a fluctuating fireball background density."

Differential predictions at the level of various kinematic variables are presented, and the calculation is made publicly available in the SuperChic MC generator. We also present general results for coincident two photon-initiated production, focussing on muon and electron pair production; while the former is rather suppressed, the latter will be ubiquitous near threshold. The impact of coincident production on exclusivity vetos in ultraperipheral measurements is discussed."

Within a non-linear relativistic mean field description, the framework allows for a systematic variation of nuclear parameters within the range allowed by uncertainties in nuclear experimental data, ensuring compatibility with nuclear theory, astrophysical and heavy-ion data. We then investigate the role of nuclear and hypernuclear parameters on NS macroscopic properties and $f$-mode oscillations in hot neutron stars within Cowling approximation. Our results reveal that in hyperonic neutron stars with trapped neutrinos, the saturation nuclear density shows moderate to strong correlation with NS astrophysical observables. We also investigate the $C-Love$ universal relations for this model and provide fit relations for hot NS configurations in the neutrino-trapped regime."

In this paper, we focus on a system of n qubits, identically coupled to a single oscillator via JC interaction, also known as the Tavis-Cummings (TC) Hamiltonian. We show that all permutationally-invariant unitaries on an arbitrary number of qubits can be realized using this permutationally-invariant Hamiltonian, which couples the qubits to an oscillator initialized in its vacuum state, together with global uniform x and z fields on all qubits. This includes useful gates, such as controlled-Z gate with an arbitrary number of control qubits. As a corollary, we find that all permutationally invariant states -- including useful entangled states such as GHZ and Dicke states -- can be prepared using this interaction and global fields. We also characterize unitaries that can be realized on the joint Hilbert space of the qubits and oscillator with the TC interaction and global z field, and develop new methods for preparing the state of the oscillator in an arbitrary initial state. We present various examples of explicit circuits for the case of n=2 qubits. In particular, we develop new methods for implementing controlled-Z, SWAP, iSWAP, and $\\sqrt{i\\text{SWAP}}$ gates using only the TC interaction and a global z field. Our work also reveals an accidental symmetry in the TC Hamiltonian and shows that it can be explained using Schwinger's oscillator model of angular momentum."

      "summary": "arXiv:2506.03782v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Event classifiers are the most fundamental observables to probe the system size and event topology of high-energy collisions. Significant progress has been made to establish suitable event classifiers to probe different physics processes occurring in elementary $e^{+}e^{-}$ to heavy-ion collisions in a range of center of mass energies. One of the major motivations to revisit event classifiers at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) originates from the recent measurements of high multiplicity proton-proton collisions, which have revealed that these small collision systems exhibit features similar to the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), traditionally believed to be only achievable in heavy nucleus-nucleus collisions at ultra-relativistic energies. To pinpoint the origin of these QGP-like phenomena with substantially reduced auto-correlation and selection biases, and to bring all collision systems on equal footing, along with charged-particle multiplicity, lately several event topology classifiers such as transverse sphericity, transverse spherocity, relative transverse activity classifier, and charged-particle flattenicity have been used extensively in experiments as well as in the phenomenological front. In this review article, we extensively discuss the purpose, coverage, and usage guidelines of these event shape classifiers, which can be crucial given the upcoming measurements in a precision era during Runs 3 and 4 of the LHC. In most cases, the event shape observables are found to be better probes in understanding the heavy-ion-like behavior seen at the LHC, while making a multi-differential study of multihadron production dynamics in hadronic and nuclear collisions."

In the original SuSAM model, a universal scaling function was fitted to a selected set of quasielastic electron scattering (e,e') cross section data, using a phenomenological ansatz inspired by the Relativistic Mean Field model of nuclear matter. In this work, we refine the procedure by first fitting a longitudinal scaling function directly to experimental longitudinal response data. Subsequently, a separate transverse scaling function is extracted from purely transverse data, after subtracting the longitudinal contribution already determined. We find that the resulting transverse scaling function must exhibit an explicit dependence on the momentum transfer q in order to reproduce all kinematics consistently. The resulting SuSAM-v2 model simultaneously describes inclusive quasielastic cross sections and both longitudinal and transverse response functions in electron scattering. The model is then applied to neutrino-nucleus scattering, showing an improved prediction compared to the previous SuSAM-v1 version, due to a more accurate treatment of the relative contributions of the longitudinal and transverse weak nuclear responses."

The ensemble is conditioned with state-of-the-art astrophysical and theoretical inputs in a fully Bayesian approach. I study how the current data affect the posterior probability of the location and the strength of FOPT. I find that the previously observed peak structure of the sound speed remains stable against inclusion of FOPTs. While the current data cannot differentiate between a smooth crossover and a first-order phase transition, 91% of the total evidence consists of equations of state with some form of phase changes, such as FOPT occurring within or terminating the stable branch of neutron stars, or an indication of a crossover to quark matter."
