      "summary": "Author(s): Y. Maekawa et al. (The Super-Kamiokande Collaboration)The Super-Kamiokande detector has measured solar neutrinos for more than 25 years. The sensitivity for solar neutrino measurement is limited by the uncertainties of energy scale and background modeling. Decays of unstable isotopes with relatively long half-lives through nuclear muon capture, such as…[Phys. Rev. C 112, 064614] Published Wed Dec 31, 2025"
