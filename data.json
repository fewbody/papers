      "summary": "arXiv:2510.01512v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present the first set of fully-nonlinear, necessary and sufficient conditions guaranteeing causal evolution of the initial data for the Israel-Stewart hydrodynamic equations with shear and bulk viscosity coupled to a nonzero baryon current. These constraints not only provide nonlinear causality: they also (a) guarantee the existence of a locally well-posed evolution of the initial data (they enforce strong hyperbolicity) when excluding the endpoints of the bounds, (b) arise from purely algebraic constraints that make no underlying symmetry assumptions on the degrees of freedom and (c) propagate the relevant symmetries of the degrees of freedom over the entire evolution of the problem. Our work enforces a mathematically rigorous foundation for future studies of viscous relativistic hydrodynamics with baryon-rich matter including neutron star mergers and heavy-ion collisions."

In the spectrum of $^{7}$Li, an EP is found for the $5/2^-$ doublet, where the two states coalesce in both energy and width, the phase rigidity vanishes, and the S-matrix develops a double pole. These features manifest directly in observables: the elastic cross section acquires a split-peak structure, and the phase shift shows a single $2\\pi$ jump. This work demonstrates that GSM-CC provides a powerful framework to explore EP phenomena in nuclei and their experimental signatures."

      "summary": "arXiv:2510.02053v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We investigate the effects of the sharpness of the phase transition between hadronic matter and quark matter on various properties of neutron stars. We construct hybrid equations of state by combining a hadronic model with a quark model using a Gaussian function. This approach introduces a smooth transition characterized by two parameters: one representing the overpressure relative to the first-order phase transition point, and the other related to the range over which the hybrid region extends in baryon chemical potential. We find that the sharpness of the phase transition significantly influences the equation of state, which can deviate by several tens of $\\text{MeV fm}^{-3}$ from the one with a sharp first-order transition. The speed of sound exhibits diverse behaviors, including drastic drops, pronounced peaks, and oscillatory patterns, depending on the sharpness parameters. In terms of stellar structure, while the maximum neutron star mass remains largely unaffected by the sharpness of the phase transition, the stellar radii can vary significantly. Smoother transitions lead to a leftward shift (up to 1 km) of the mass-radius curve segment corresponding to hybrid stars. The tidal deformability decreases with smoother transitions, especially for higher-mass stars. Our results are quite general and do not qualitatively depend on the specific hadronic and quark matter models employed. In fact, the hybrid equation of state and stellar properties derived from microscopic models of quark-hadron pasta phases display the same behavior as described above."

      "summary": "arXiv:2510.02124v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In this work, we introduce a new qubit mapping strategy for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) applied to nuclear shell model calculations, where each Slater determinant (SD) is mapped to a qubit, rather than assigning qubits to individual single-particle states. While this approach may increase the total number of qubits required in some cases, it enables the construction of simpler quantum circuits that are more compatible with current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We apply this method to seven nuclei, including four lithium isotopes $^{(6-9)}$Li from \\textit{p}-shell, $^{18}$F from \\textit{sd}-shell, and two heavier nuclei ($^{210}$Po, and $^{210}$Pb). We run those circuits representing their g. s. on noisy simulator (FakeFez backend) and quantum hardware ($ibm\\_pittsburgh$). For heavier nuclei, we demonstrate the feasibility of simulating $^{210}$Po and $^{210}$Pb as 22- and 29-qubit systems, respectively. Additionally, we employ Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) via two-qubit gate folding to mitigate errors in both simulated and hardware-executed results. Post-mitigation, the best results show less than 4 \\% deviation from shell model predictions across all nuclei studied. This SD-based qubit mapping proves particularly effective for lighter nuclei and two-nucleon systems, offering a promising route for near-term quantum simulations in nuclear physics."

We present a personal selection of elementary applications such as the relation between hadronic production amplitudes or form factors to scattering, and the extraction of resonance properties on unphysical Riemann sheets. More advanced topics such as Roy equations for pion--pion scattering and dispersion relations for three-body decays are briefly touched upon."

The ensuing eigenstates are free of the center of mass motion and satisfy exact Dirichlet boundary conditions. Hyperfine interactions in the form of color-spin or flavor-spin are shown to lift the degeneracy of the 16 pentastates, with a spectrum that compares fairly with some of the empirical nucleon excited states. The quark PDF for the light pentastates is discussed."

This approximation is valid in the high-energy limit of scattering, corresponding to the small-$x$ regime. The shockwave framework allows us to employ the eikonal approximation and express the parton distributions in terms of Wilson-line correlators, naturally formulated within the color-glass condensate effective field theory. We present a comprehensive set of Feynman rules for evaluating parton distributions in this limit, and demonstrate how they can be systematically applied to calculate all phenomenologically relevant leading-twist parton distributions at leading order. This work establishes a unified starting point for future studies that aim to bridge the color-glass condensate approach with the partonic description of the nucleon."

To evaluate the influence of nuclear structure and potential alpha clustering, we implemented four candidate configurations: Woods-Saxon, tetrahedron, square, and NLEFT. Initial-state geometry is quantified via the eccentricity cumulant ratio $\\varepsilon_{2}\\{4\\}/\\varepsilon_{2}\\{2\\}$, which provides a robust and evolution-independent measure sensitive to configuration differences. The model reproduces $v_{2}(p_{\\mathrm{T}})$ at low $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and $v_{3}(p_{\\mathrm{T}})$ across the full $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ range, with integrated $v_{2}\\{2\\}$ and $v_{3}\\{2\\}$ matching the STAR data, demonstrating that transport dynamics captures the essential collectivity in this intermediate-size system. These findings establish a baseline for extending nuclear-structure studies in O+O collisions to other energies and differential observables within a unified transport model framework."

Theoretical descriptions to obtain $A_z$ based on an intuitive picture as well as a distorted wave impulse approximation are presented, showing that the helicity of incident protons is coupled to the chirality of the orbital motion of a single-particle wave function, resulting in the chirality of the final states and a large $A_z$ value."

      "summary": "arXiv:2303.08143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The future electron-ion collider (EIC) will produce the first-ever high energy collisions between electrons and a wide range of nuclei, opening a new era in the study of cold nuclear matter. Quarks and gluons produced in these collisions will propagate through the dense nuclear matter of nuclei, imprinting its structure into subtle correlations in the energy flux of final state hadrons. In this article, we apply recent developments from the field of jet substructure, namely the energy correlator observables, to decode these correlations and provide a new window into nuclear structure. The energy correlators provide a calibrated probe of the scale dependence of vacuum quantum chromodynamics (QCD), enabling medium modifications to be imaged and interpreted as a function of scale. Using the eHIJING parton shower to simulate electron-nucleus collisions, we demonstrate that the size of the nucleus is imprinted as an angular scale in the correlators, with a magnitude that is visible for realistic EIC kinematics. We can observe the size difference between the proposed EIC nuclear targets ${}^3$He, ${}^4$He, ${}^{12}$C, ${}^{40}$Ca, ${}^{64}$Cu, ${}^{197}$Au, and ${}^{238}$U, showing that the energy correlators can image femtometer length scales using asymptotic energy flux. Our approach offers a unified view of jet substructure across collider experiments, and provides numerous new theoretical tools to unravel the complex dynamics of QCD in extreme environments, both hot and cold."

      "summary": "arXiv:2501.09738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Calculations of the parton distribution function (PDF) and distribution amplitude (DA) are highly relevant to core experimental programs as they provide non-perturbative inputs to inclusive and exclusive processes, respectively. Direct computation of the PDFs and DAs remains challenging because they are non-perturbative quantities defined as light-cone correlators of quark and gluon fields, and are therefore inherently time-dependent. In this work, we use a uniform quantum strategy based on tensor network simulation techniques to directly extract these hadronic quantities from first principles using the matrix product state of the hadrons in the same setup. We present exemplary numerical calculations with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in 1+1 dimensions and compare with available exact diagonalization and quantum circuit simulation results. Using tensor networks, we evaluate the PDF and DA at various strong couplings in the large-qubit limit, which is consistent with expectations at perturbative and non-relativistic limits."
