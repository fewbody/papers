For the first time isospin-breaking effects, charge-independence breaking as well as charge-symmetry breaking, and the two-pion exchange interaction up to next-to-next-to-next-to leading order are included on the lattice. A high-quality description of the two-nucleon phase-shift and mixing-angle parameters is achieved up to 200 MeV/c relative momentum. The deuteron properties are accurately reproduced.

These structures are caused by refractive scattering and are separated by Airy minima. Their importance stems from their close relationship to the interaction potential between two $^{12}$C nuclei, which also describes the molecular resonances of the compound system at lower energies. Although a unique deep potential was usually determined from rainbow scattering at higher energies, a puzzling discrepancy persisted: the energy at which the Airy minimum $A1$ crosses 90$^\\circ$ was $E_{c.m.}\\approx$67 MeV for $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C. This is remarkably low compared to approximately 100 MeV for both the $^{16}$O+$^{12}$C and $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O systems. This question remained unanswered until the discovery of the secondary rainbow in the $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C system. We report for the first time that the highest energy at which the dynamically generated Airy minimum of the secondary rainbow crosses 90$^\\circ$ is about 100 MeV. This demonstrates that the fourth Airy elephant exists between the Airy minimum $A1$ of the primary nuclear rainbow and that, $A1^{(S)}$, of the secondary rainbow. The long-standing problem concerning the Airy minima and Airy elephants has finally been resolved after decades of concern by recognizing the existence of a dynamically generated secondary rainbow in $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C scattering."

These constraints are algebraic inequalities that make no assumption on the underlying geometry of the spacetime, or the equation of state. In order to highlight the distinct physical and structural behavior of the two hydrodynamic frames, we discuss the special ultrarelativistic ideal gas equation of state considered in earlier literature in $D = 1 + 1$ dimensions, and show that our general $D = 3 + 1$ constraints reduce to their results upon an appropriate choice of angles. For this equation of state in both $D = 1 + 1$ and $D = 3 + 1$ dimensions one can show that: (i) there exists a region allowed by nonlinear causality in which the baryon current transitions into a spacelike vector in the Landau frame, and (ii) an analogous argument shows that the solutions of the Eckart frame equations of motion never violate the dominant energy condition, assuming nonlinear causality holds. We then compare our results with those from linearized Israel-Stewart theory and show that the linear causality bounds fail to capture the new physical constraints on energy and number diffusion that are successfully obtained"

In this context, it is important to identify possible low-lying vibrational excitations and to characterize the excitation energy at which they emerge. Focusing on two typical examples, $^{166}$Er and $^{162}$Dy, vibrational states are indeed identified above the $\\gamma$ band using an extended version of the so-called T-plot. The phenomenon of shape coexistence is also shown to produce low-lying states below such vibrational band heads. These results suggest novel and rich structures in heavy deformed nuclei. While experimental counterparts are seen for some of such states, others are predictions opening doors to future dedicated experiments."

As a function of the centrality of the collision, it changes sign and varies non-monotonically. We show that this is naturally explained by two combined effects. The first effect is a skewness in initial-state fluctuations, which is quantified by the correlation between the geometry-driven elliptic deformation in the reaction plane and the fluctuation-driven triangularity $\\varepsilon_3$. We introduce an intensive measure of this skewness, which is generically of order unity and depends weakly on the system size and centrality. We evaluate its magnitude using Monte Carlo simulations of the initial state, which show that it is sensitive to the nucleon width. The second effect is the fluctuation of impact parameter relative to centrality classifiers used by experiment. The ATLAS collaboration uses two different centrality classifiers, the multiplicity $N_{ch}$ and the transverse energy $E_T$. We fit both sets of results for Pb+Pb collisions up to $\\approx 40\\%$ centrality with a single parameter, the intensive mixed skewness. Its value inferred from experiment agrees with theoretical expectations."

This approach is applied to the isoscalar mono- and quadrupole as well as the isovector dipole response of closed-shell nuclei from $^4$He to $^{78}$Ni for different chiral two- and three-nucleon interactions. We find that the inclusion of many-body correlations in the nuclear ground state significantly impacts the multipole response when going from the random-phase approximation to the IMSRG level. Our IMSRG calculations lead to an improved description of experimental data in $^{16}$O and $^{40}$Ca, including a good reproduction of the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn enhancement factor. These findings highlight the utility of the moment method as a benchmark for other ab initio approaches that describe nuclear response functions through the explicit treatment of excited states."

The results obtained show a reduction of the vector, axial and vector-axial transverse response functions and, consequently, a decrease in the total neutrino cross section. In addition to a comparison with the non-relativistic limit, other models are also explored, such as the relativistic mean field model for nuclear matter and the superscaling analysis with relativistic effective mass, both of which yield qualitatively similar results."

Field-theoretical calculations of the transport coefficients such as the shear and bulk viscosities require Kubo formulae which in turn require real-time correlation functions of stress-energy tensors. Consequently, knowing the analytic structure of these correlation functions is essential in any such studies. Using the energy-conservation laws and the results from the gravity-hydrodynamics analysis, we determine the low-frequency and low-wavenumber analytic structures of all stress-energy correlation functions in the rest frame of the medium. By comparing with the diffusion and sound spectra from the second-order and the third-order relativistic hydrodynamics, various new Kubo formulae are derived in the limit where the zero-frequency limit is taken first. We also show that the meaning of the Kubo formulae for relaxation times can change when higher-order terms are added to hydrodynamics. A subtle issue of taking the zero frequency and zero wavenumber limits when using skeleton diagrams is addressed as well."

Our analysis systematically covers spatial dimensions D=1,2,3 , with the aim of identifying the regimes in which the approximation remains valid when applied to commonly used model interaction potentials. Specifically, we focus on the square well and delta shell potentials, both of which admit analytical solutions for the s-wave scattering problem in all dimensions considered. By employing the exact analytical expressions for the s-wave scattering phase shift, we perform a direct comparison between the exact on-shell matrix element of the interaction potential and their corresponding approximations across a range of collision momenta. Particular attention is given to the low-energy regime. Our findings indicate that, although the on-shell approximation generally improves with increasing momentum, its accuracy also improves for weaker potentials. Remarkably, in the limit of weak interactions, we demonstrate that the on-shell approximation becomes exact at leading order. In this regime, the approximation offers a controlled means of deriving the low-momentum expansion of the potential and may serve as a useful tool in constructing effective interactions for quantum field theories."

L\\\"uscher's finite-size method is one of the well established methods for calculating the scattering phase shifts between two hadrons in lattice QCD simulations. Several studies have used simulations under the periodic boundary condition to determine the scattering phase shifts at a few discrete momenta for the $DD^*$ system. However, the scattering phase shift has not been investigated for the $BB^*$ system. In this study, $S$- and $P$-wave scattering phase shifts for the $DD^*$ and $BB^*$ systems in both $I=0$ and $I=1$ channels under several types of partially twisted boundary conditions. The use of the partially twisted boundary conditions enables us to obtain the scattering phase shift at any momentum by continuously varying the twisting angle. It also allows us to easily access the $P$-wave scattering phase shifts through the mixing of $S$- and $P$-waves, which is induced by the imposed boundary conditions. The 2+1 flavor PACS-CS gauge ensembles at $m_\\pi=295$, 411 and 569 MeV are used.

Using a two-fluid formalism with purely gravitational DM-BM interaction, we find that rotation enlarges the star, whereas DM admixture increases compactness and enhances gravitational stability. However, increased compactness due to DM lowers the threshold for rotational instabilities, making DM-admixed stars more susceptible. Rotation decreases temperature profiles by redistributing thermal energy over a larger volume and reducing central density, while DM raises temperatures by deepening the gravitational potential and increasing thermal energy. Stars become more prone to collapse and rotational instabilities as frequency ($\\nu$) rises and the polar-to-equatorial radius ratio ($r_p/r_e$) decreases, especially near the Keplerian limit ($\\nu_K$). DM-admixed stars also show higher surface gravitational redshifts due to their compactness. Our results qualitatively agree with universal relations primarily derived for rotating cold stars. These findings highlight competing effects of rotation and DM on NS thermal evolution, structure, and observables, potentially offering indirect probes of DM within NSs."

By matching the OPE with the selected nuclear potentials for nucleon-nucleon scattering states, we obtain the Wilson coefficients. The nucleon momentum distribution in the deuteron is then used to test the OPE against the predictions of these nuclear potentials. In order to achieve a systematic separation of short-range and long-range interactions, we discuss how the OPE approximation can be improved by including higher-order EFT potentials and higher-dimension local operators."

We list and classify all the possible contributions up to first order in gradients of hydrodynamic fields including the axial chemical potential and the spin potential, and we obtain the corresponding Kubo formulas. We find that all the possible dissipative contributions, except those coming from the gradients of spin potential, require a chiral imbalance or parity violating interactions. In a fluid with chiral imbalance we find a chiral version of the spin Hall effect, i.e. a spin polarization is induced by the gradients of temperature and of axial chemical potential in the direction orthogonal to the momentum of the particle and to the gradients. Moreover, we identify several other new non-dissipative contributions that are not present for free fields."

We focus on particles whose constituent quarks are not transported from the incoming nuclei but instead are produced in the collisions. At intermediate impact parameters, we examine quark coalescence behavior for particle combinations with identical quark content, and search for any departure from this behavior (``splitting'') for combinations having non-identical quark content. Under the assumption of quark coalescence for produced quarks, the splitting strength appears to increase with the electric charge difference of the constituent quarks in the combinations, consistent with electromagnetic effect expectations."

We used the density-dependent quark mass model (DDQM) to access the microscopic nuclear equation of state (EoS) in a series of snapshots. The strange quark matter (SQM) is studied at finite temperature and entropy, in the presence of electrons and muons and their corresponding neutrinos to simulate the BNS merger conditions. For the first time, we introduced temperature into the DDQM model using a lattice QCD-motivated approach to construct both isentropic and isothermal EoSs. We observe that as the entropy of the SQM increases, the merger remnant becomes more massive and increases in size, whereas the neutrino abundance also increases. In the fixed-temperature case, on the other hand, we observe that the entropy spreads from the surface towards the center of the remnant. We determine the particle distribution in the core of the remnants, the structure of the remnant, the temperature profile, sound velocity, and the polytropic index, and discuss their effects. The strange-quark star (SQS) remnants satisfy the $2\\,{\\rm M_\\odot}$ mass constraint associated with neutron stars (NS)."

After constructing the spherical background configuration by solving two ordinary differential equations as usual, these three moments are obtained by solving four additional ordinary differential equations. They are solved numerically from the stellar center to the surface, and we do not need to derive homogeneous solutions for obtaining the quadrupole moment. This small number of ordinary differential equations to be solved enables us to identify the primary variable for each second-order moment. Investigating the profile of these variables in the star, we speculate that their nonmonotonic behavior, enhanced typically for soft equations of state and/or high compactnesses, introduces the variety to the relations among these second-order moments unless the black-hole limit is approached. Because realistic relativistic stars are widely believed to be characterized by stiff equations of state, they enjoy the universal relation to a great extent."

In order to calculate the form factors of the Λb baryon transition matrix element, we employ the phase-moment parameterization and perform fits to the Lattice QCD data. With the help of the obtained form factors, six helicity amplitudes and the differential decay widths are evaluated. Through appropriate angular integrations, we express the helicity flip, helicity nonflip integrated decay rates, and the lepton-side forward–backward asymmetry. We present a numerical analysis of these physical observables. We obtain the mentioned physical quantities by performing fits to the Lattice QCD data using the well-known Boyd–Grinstein–Lebed parametrization. Comparisons with other experimental and theoretical data are also discussed."
