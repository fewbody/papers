Using event-shape observables, one can constrain the probability distributions of anisotropic flow coefficients, thus reducing the linear and nonlinear contributions in the measured higher-order harmonics. In this paper, we use transverse spherocity as an event shape observable to study the flow coefficients and elliptic flow fluctuations. Transverse spherocity is found to have a strong correlation with elliptic flow and its fluctuations. We exploit this feature of transverse spherocity to remove the contribution of elliptic flow from higher-order harmonics. The study is performed in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV using a multi-phase transport model. The multi-particle Q-cumulant method estimates the anisotropic flow coefficients, which reduces the non-flow contributions. We observe a stronger system response to the flow coefficients for the events with smaller values of elliptic flow."

By applying a second-order expansion of the statistical operator in hydrodynamic gradients, we show that new second-order terms arise from the coupling of two-point quantum correlators between tensors of different ranks evaluated at distinct space-time points. These terms emerge due to the presence of the acceleration vector in the system, which enables the generalization of Curie's theorem-based symmetry constraints for constructing invariants from tensors of different ranks at separate space-time locations. In a generic quantum system described by the energy-momentum tensor, multiple conserved charges, and spin tensors, we identify these new terms within a complete set of second-order equations governing the shear-stress tensor, bulk-viscous pressure, charge-diffusion currents, rotational stress tensor, and boost-heat vector. Furthermore, we express all transport coefficients in the theory represented by two-point or three-point correlation functions as retarded Green's functions."

However, for the three-pion exchange potential, scheme-dependent contributions are expected to appear already at the static level. Here, we analyze the leading and subleading chiral $3\\pi$-exchange NN potentials using the method of unitary transformation. In line with the expectations, our results for selected classes of contributions differ from those obtained by Kaiser using S-matrix matching.

Vibrational and rotational features were studied concerning energy to distinguish their respective effects on fusion properties. The results indicate that the theoretical calculations for the nuclei $^{74}$Ge, $^{148}$Nd, $^{182}$W and $^{186}$W closely match the experimental data, particularly for the $2^+$ excited states. While slight discrepancies are observed for other excited states ($4^+$ and $6^+$), overall agreement remains significant. Additionally, the study reveals that hexadecapole deformation with different magnitudes have significant influences on the fusion cross-section. In cases where $\\beta_4$ has a positive value, rotational levels beyond $6^+$ have minimal impact on the cross-section, resulting in a notable difference in the contribution of sequential channels. In contrast, for negative $\\beta_4$ values, rotational energy levels up to the $2^+$ state substantially affect the fusion characteristics. Furthermore, the analysis extends to the estimation of the relative change ($\\Delta\\sigma_{fus}$) between the excited states and the ground state, both with and without considering coupling terms."

We have developed a unified framework for jet and bulk medium evolution within a multiphase transport approach where the jets and medium share energy and momentum via multiple elastic scatterings and medium-induced gluon radiation during the parton transport. The formulation enables realistic predictions of jet based observables extended to a large radius of the jet cone in central Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV. The model provides reasonable quantitative agreement with the experimental data from inclusive jet suppression and the full jet shape function up to large radial distances induced by both the collisional and radiative jet energy loss and migration of the lost $p_T$ in the medium. We find that gradual degradation of jet energy through gluon emissions alters the energy-momentum evolution in the jet, essential to describe the entire range of jet shape ratio relative to proton-proton collisions. Pure collisional energy loss injects appreciable $p_T$ broadening and migration of the medium partons, resulting in an enhanced population at large angular distances in the jet-shape ratio."

Using the hadronic transport model AMPT-HC, hypernucleus-nucleus collision is studied. It is found that at beam energies below the threshold for hyperon production, the hyperon elliptic flow exhibits noticeable asymmetry between the positive and negative rapidity regions and is sensitive to the strength of the hyperon potential, especially in the large negative rapidity region. One can extract the hyperon potential approximately twice the saturation density based on the hyperon elliptic flow in the negative rapidity region, and the hyperon potential around the saturation density based on the hyperon elliptic flow in the positive rapidity region."

Employing simple, but efficient, parameterizations of the light curve based on a broken power law in terms of physical parameters, fitted to a large dataset of synthetic light curves, we apply basic machine learning techniques to determine the approximate connection between key input parameters of the forward shock model and the light curve parameters. Solving then the inverse problem, we find that the strength of the central engine can be reasonably accurately estimated even with very limited information.

The latter fulfills the necessary condition for the normalization of the mean spin polarization, which the former fails to reproduce. Moreover, the new form of the local equilibrium Wigner function leads to generalized thermodynamic relations for perfect spin hydrodynamics, which were found before in the approach using the classical concept of spin.

      "summary": "arXiv:2407.06407v5 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: We employ the multipole expansion within the unified electroweak theory to develop a complete calculation method of the electron scattering cross section for light nuclei. The specific calculations for 6,7Li and 7Be nuclei indicate that the conventional impulse approximation can be applied to the electron-nucleus scattering only when the incident electron energy does not exceed twice the nucleon mass. In addition, the quasi-elastic scattering cross section of 7Li in the excitation from its ground state to the nearest excited state and that of elastic scattering in the ground state are independently treated, whereas they have not been separately measured in experiments. The obtained scattering cross sections corresponding to an appropriate adjustment of the harmonic oscillator parameter along with the V-A structure interpret reasonably well the available experimental data at MeV energies and provide predictive information at GeV energies. This gives new perspectives in studying the structure of nuclei and the weak interactions via electron or lepton scattering at high (GeV) energies, considering nuclei rather than quarks."

Using the INCL+ABLA and AMPT-HC models, we systematically investigate C+C collisions at beam energies of 1.1 and 1.9 GeV/nucleon to explore the sensitivity of hyperon and hypernuclei yields to the EoS and hyperon potential. Our results reveal that Lambda hyperon production is predominantly influenced by the nuclear EoS, while light hypernuclei formation (e.g., \\(^3_{\\Lambda}\\)H) exhibits stronger sensitivity to the hyperon potential at high/low densities with the incident beam energies of 1.1/1.9 GeV. The study provides a framework for future experiments at facilities like HIAF and FAIR/GSI to resolve the hyperon puzzle, thus advancing our understanding of quantum chromodynamics in high-density regimes."

      "summary": "arXiv:2411.04244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The highly energetic particle medium formed in the ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision displays a notable difference in the temperatures between its central and peripheral regions. This temperature gradient can generate an electric field within the medium, a phenomenon referred to as the Seebeck effect. We have estimated the Seebeck coefficient for a dense quark-gluon plasma medium by using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in the recently developed novel relaxation time approximation (RTA) model within the kinetic theory framework. This study explores the Seebeck coefficient of individual quark flavors as well as the entire partonic medium. Our observation indicates that, for given current quark masses, the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient for each quark flavor as well as for the partonic medium decreases as the temperature rises and increases as the chemical potential increases. Furthermore, we have investigated the Seebeck effect by considering the partonic interactions within the quasiparticle model. In addition, we have presented a comparison between our findings and the results of the standard RTA model. We have observed that the Seebeck coefficient of the QGP medium gets conspicuously decreased in the novel RTA model as compared to that in the standard RTA model. A decreased Seebeck coefficient in the novel RTA model describes a smaller magnitude of induced electric field in the medium than that estimated by the standard RTA model. However, the rate of decline gets gradually smaller as the medium gets hotter for both the current quark mass scenario and the quasiparticle mass scenario. It is also found that, in the noninteracting case, the Seebeck coefficient possesses a slightly negative value in the high temperature region, unlike the quasiparticle description, where the Seebeck coefficient remains positive for the entire temperature range."

We use a functional formulation with covariant gauge fixing and derive Renormalization Group flow equations for the gauge coupling, quark mass and an algebraically complete set of local fermion-fermion interaction vertices. The flow, based on a convenient Callan-Symanzik-type regularization, shows the expected behavior for a super-renormalizable theory in the ultraviolet regime and leads to a strongly coupled regime in the infrared. Through a detailed discussion of symmetry implications, and variations in the gauge group and flavor numbers, the analysis sets the stage for a more detailed investigation of the bound state spectrum in future work."

These form factors encode critical information about the internal dynamics and spatial distribution of energy, momentum, and internal forces within the proton. The flavor decomposition of the quark sector indicates the role of each flavor in the proton's pressure and shear force distributions. Our results show that the up quark contributes more significantly compared to the down quark in the three conserved proton GFFs, as well as in the energy and shear force distributions. Additionally, we define the non-conserved form factor $\\bar{c}^q (t)$, which takes part in the distributions of energy and pressure; the latter is essential for maintaining proton stability. Furthermore, we determine the proton's mass and mechanical radii, providing valuable insight into its internal structure and dynamics."

Because of the Umklapp processes, we only find a mode for energy diffusion. The symmetric correlator exhibits transport peak near zero frequency with a width approximately proportional to momentum squared at small momentum, when the system is fully quantum ergodic, as indicated by the eigenenergy level statistics. This transport peak leads to a power-law $t^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ decay of the symmetric correlator at late time, also known as the long-time tail, as well as diffusion-like spreading in position space. We also introduce a quantum algorithm for computing the symmetric correlator on a quantum computer and find it gives results consistent with exact diagonalization when tested on the IBM emulator. Finally we discuss the future prospect of searching for the sound modes."

We show that the energy-momentum tensor receives corrections with respect to the standard local-equilibrium result. Notably, the relation between the energy density and pressure, i.e., the equation of state, is modified with respect to the one in global equilibrium. The obtained corrections might be relevant for systems created in relativistic hadron and heavy-ion collisions."
