      "summary": "The study of black hole (BH) shadows provides crucial insights into the nature of strong gravitational effects and the intricate structure of spacetime surrounding BHs. In this study, we investigate the shadow of a Kerr MOG BH in a plasma environment, examining the extent to which the presence of plasma alters the characteristics of the observed shadow compared with that in vacuum conditions. Our analysis reveals that the shadow characteristics of M87* and Sgr A* are more compatible with event horizon telescope (EHT) observational data in nonhomogeneous plasma spacetime than in homogeneous plasma spacetime. For a small metric deformation parameter , the shadow aligns within uncertainty for homogeneous plasma and within for nonhomogeneous plasma. Next, we determine the energy emission rate for the Kerr MOG BH and analyze the influence of parameters Î±, , , and on particle emissions in the BH vicinity. We further analyze the deflection angle in the presence of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous plasma profiles. The findings indicate notable differences from the vacuum scenario, underscoring the importance of accounting for plasma effects in examining light propagation around compact objects."
