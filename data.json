We utilize the relativistic mean-field model with a density-dependent isovector coupling constant fitted by varying values of the symmetry energy slope $L$ to describe the hadronic matter, while the quark matter is described by a modified MIT bag model with vector interactions. We construct the hadron-quark phase transition using the energy minimization (EM) method and compare with the Gibbs construction (GC) in the hybrid star. We find that the massive hybrid stars generally tend to have a hadron-quark pasta phase core rather than a pure quark core for most values of $L$, except in some special cases where they have a small pure quark core. Furthermore, we show that the mass and size of the pasta phase core are strongly influenced by the symmetry energy. The radius associated with the onset of pasta phases is also influenced by the symmetry energy. Additionally, we also evaluate the effects of the surface tension $\\sigma$, the bag constant $B$, and the vector interaction $G_{V}$."

The dynamical portion of our calculation was performed within the proton neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (pn QRPA) model. Six nuclei (20O, 24Ne, 34Si, 54Ti, 62Fe, and 98Zr) were selected for the present calculation. We compare the calculated PSFs for these cases against the traditionally used recipe. In our new approach, the Dirac equation was numerically solved employing a Coulomb potential. This potential was adopted from a more realistic proton distribution of the daughter nucleus. Thus, the finite size of the nucleus and the diffuse nuclear surface corrections are taken into account. Moreover, a screened Coulomb potential was constructed to account for the effect of atomic screening. The power series technique was used for the numerical solution. The calculated values of half-lives, employing the recently developed method for computation of PSFs, were in good agreement with the experimental data."

A robust description of heavy-flavor transport coefficients requires a microscopic approach that treats the open and hidden heavy-flavor sectors on the same footing. Here, we employ the quantum many-body $T$-matrix formalism to evaluate the dissociation rates of heavy quarkonia in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The basic ingredient is the heavy-light $T$-matrix, which utilizes a nonperturbative driving kernel constrained by lattice-QCD data. Its resummation in a ladder series provides a much enhanced interaction strength compared to previously used perturbative coupling to the quasiparticle partons in the QGP. The in-medium quarkonium properties, particularly their temperature-dependent binding energies, are evaluated self-consistently using the same interaction kernel, including interference effects (also referred to as the imaginary part of the heavy-quark potential) as well as off-shell parton spectral functions. We systematically investigate the interplay of these effects and elaborate on the connections to the dipole approximation used in effective field theory."

This study is performed in the hybrid approach SMASH-vHLLE, composed of the hadronic transport approach SMASH and the (3+1)D viscous hydrodynamic code vHLLE. A Bayesian framework is employed, utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to explore the parameter space. The analysis compares model predictions against experimental observables, including particle yields, momentum and flow coefficients both at midrapidity as well as in forward and backward direction. We find that the SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid framework, using hadronic initial conditions for Au+Au collisions at different beam energies, can reproduce a variety of experimental observables at midrapidity and forward/backward rapidities. Notably, the preferred posterior distribution suggests a near-vanishing specific shear viscosity in the high-temperature QGP phase, combined with moderate-to-large bulk viscosity around the phase transition region, although the constraints on baryochemical potential dependence are weak. Our findings reveal that a hadronic initial condition constrains the evolution more strictly at intermediate energies, making parameters such as the hydrodynamic onset time highly sensitive. Intriguingly, the extracted shear viscosity differs substantially from previous Bayesian analyses, motivating further systematic studies with higher-statistics data sets and refined modeling assumptions."

With the success for nuclear matter, the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF) theory with covariant chiral interactions is a promising ab initio approach to describe both nuclear matter and finite nuclei. In the description of the finite nuclei with the current RBHF theory, the covariant chiral interactions have to be localized to make calculations feasible. In order to examine the reliability and validity, in this letter, the RBHF theory with local and nonlocal covariant chiral interactions at leading order are applied for nuclear matter. The low-energy constants in the covariant chiral interactions determined with the local regularization are close to those with the nonlocal regularization. Moreover, the RBHF theory with local and nonlocal covariant chiral interactions provide equally well description of the saturation properties of nuclear matter. The present work paves the way for the implementation of covariant chiral interactions in RBHF theory for finite nuclei."

This novel input allows for a consistent description of the $e^+e^-$ data, proton+proton data and finally nucleus-nucleus data at all investigated energies. We conclude that the observed isospin violation in nucleus-nucleus reactions is explained by asymmetric production of up- and down-quarks in the elementary color field fragmentation process."

Two teleportation-like phenomena were predicted by quantum mechanics: quantum teleportation and, recently, quantum particle teleportation. The former is investigated experimentally and has applications in quantum communication and computing.\n  Here, we introduced the third teleportation-like phenomenon - an apparent teleportation. It seems to be a natural consequence of elementary particles and antiparticles of the Standard Model being indistinguishable. We give an example of a process leading to the apparent teleportation within a toy model of boson-like particles. It utilizes the local transport of particles and antiparticles and the local creation and annihilation of particle-antiparticle pairs. Furthermore, we suggest a method to observe the apparent teleportation in nucleus-nucleus collisions at properly selected collision energy. The method requires the measurement of correlations between momenta of charm and anticharm hadrons in collisions with a single $c\\bar{c}$ pair being produced. The ultimate prediction following the apparent teleportation hypothesis is the uncorrelated emission of charm and anticharm hadrons. It can be tested by contemporary experiments.\n  Observing the apparent teleportation would uncover the basic transport properties of indistinguishable particles. In particular, the apparent teleportation may explain the rapid thermalisation of the system created in collisions of two atomic nuclei. Theoretical and experimental efforts are needed to observe the apparent teleportation processes and study their properties."

The results are compared in the potential and QFT approaches of the eikonal model. In the case of proton Coulomb scattering at the LHC the difference between these two approaches is significant.

Within this model framework, the current quark mass and gluonic quantum contributions to the scale anomaly can be described by the pion and scalar meson masses, respectively, through matching with the underlying QCD. By considering the decomposition of the energy momentum tensor of nucleon, we examine the role of the scale anomaly contributions in the pressure inside the nucleon. As a result, the gluonic scale anomaly is found to dominate the confining pressure. Compared to the result based on the conventional chiral perturbation theory in the chiral limit, our result for the total pressure is capable of qualitatively improving the alignment with lattice QCD observations. Moreover, the pressure from the gluonic scale anomaly is widely distributed in position space, leading to its substantial contribution to the D-term."

For the honeycomb lattice, we derive a classically ${\\cal O}(b^2)$-improved Hamiltonian, with $b$ being the lattice spacing.

We observe that $SU(2)$ Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory does not provide an unambiguous prediction for the sign of the FV correction, which is not surprising when one also considers large-$N_c$ constraints on the axial couplings. We further show that non-monotonic FV corrections are naturally allowed when one considers either including explicit $\\Delta$-resonance degrees of freedom or one works to higher orders in the chiral expansion. We investigate the potential impact of these FV corrections with a precision study of $g_A$ using models of FV corrections that are monotonic and non-monotonic. Using lattice QCD data that is approximately at the 1% level of precision, we do not see significant evidence of non-monotonic corrections. Looking forward to the next phase of lattice QCD calculations, we estimate that calculations that are between the 0.1%-1%-level of precision may be sensitive to these FV artifacts. Finally, we present an update of the CalLat prediction of $g_A$ in the isospin limit with sub-percent precision, $g_A^{\\rm QCD} = 1.2674(96)$."

This study utilizes a multi-phase transport model (AMPT) coupled with PYTHIA8 initial conditions. We have investigated the baryon to meson ratios as well as the strange to non-strange meson ratios varying with the charged particle density. By tuning the coalescence parameters, the AMPT model provides a reasonable description to the experimental data for inclusive productions of both light and charm hadrons, comparable to the string fragmentation model calculations with color reconnection effects. Additionally, we have analyzed the relative production of hadrons by examining self-normalized particle ratios as a function of the charged hadron density. Our findings suggest that parton evolution effects and the coalescence hadronization process in AMPT model lead to a strong flavor hierarchy in the multiplicity dependence of the baryon to meson ratio. Furthermore, our investigation on the $p_T$ differential double ratio of baryon to meson fraction between high and low multiplicity events indicates distinct modifications to the flavor associated baryon to meson ratio $p_T$ shape in high multiplicity events when comparing the coalescence hadronization model to the color reconnection model. These observations highlight the importance of understanding the hadronization process in high-energy proton-proton collisions through a comprehensive multiplicity dependent multi-flavor analysis."

It also conjectured that generically the scaling will be superlinear (although special cases exist in which it is linear). The quantity $Q_D$ depends only on the properties of ground states along the Hamiltonian path and the rate at which the path is followed.
