We explore the effect of directly introducing overlap functions computed using the Gamow shell model (GSM) into reaction calculations, taking the $\\left$ single proton overlap as a case study. By incorporating both inter-nucleon correlations and continuum coupling, the GSM provides accurate overlap functions in both interior and asymptotic regions, together with the corresponding spectroscopic factors (SFs). These theoretical SFs and overlap functions were included in a coupled channels Born approximation analysis of the \\(^{6}{\\rm He}(d,n)^7{\\rm Li}\\) transfer reaction. Overlap functions derived from \\textit{ab initio} no-core shell model (NCSM) calculations as well as standard single-particle (s.p.) wave functions were also considered for comparison. Our results reveal significant differences between the calculated angular distributions when employing theoretical SFs with standard s.p.\\ wave functions compared to the full theoretical overlap functions. Discrepancies were also observed between angular distributions calculated with GSM and NCSM overlap functions, highlighting the importance of internal structure and correct asymptotic behavior in reliable reaction calculations. The GSM overlap functions also provided a good description of the $^{208}$Pb($^7$Li,$^6$He)$^{209}$Bi reaction when included in a coupled reaction channels calculation."

The effect associated with the exceptional cutoff in the $^3P_0$ channel can be mitigated by redefining the leading-order wave function within the freedom allowed by the effective field theory. The same approach applied in the $^3S_1 \\mathrm{-}^3D_1$ channel remedies the effect of this exceptional cutoff on the ground state energy of the deuteron, but not for the triton."

Our results are based on numerical simulations of model H using a Metropolis algorithm, and we employ Kubo relations to extract transport coefficients. We observe the expected logarithmic divergence of the shear viscosity in a two-dimensional non-critical fluid. At a critical point, we find that the transport coefficients exhibit power-law scaling with the system size $L$. The strongest divergence is seen for the thermal conductivity $\\kappa$ in two dimensions. We find $\\kappa\\sim L^{x_\\kappa}$ with $x_\\kappa=1.6\\pm 0.1$.

Also we propose that the appropriate slice of the closed path provides a physical local basis at $r=0$, which is used by an origin-to-$\\infty$ open path. Our analysis clarifies, in radial settings, how mathematical monodromy data and physical boundary conditions dovetail, thereby addressing recent debates on path choices in resurgence-based quantization."

The ${Z=50}$ (tin) isotopic chain is a frontier for such studies, with particular interest in nuclear binding at and around the doubly-magic \\textsuperscript{100}Sn isotope. Precise mass measurements of neutron-deficient isotopes provide necessary anchor points for mass models to test extrapolations near the proton drip line, where experimental studies currently remain out of reach. In this work, we report the first Penning trap mass measurement of \\textsuperscript{101}Sn. The determined mass excess of $-59\\,889.89(96)$~keV for \\textsuperscript{101}Sn represents a factor of 300 improvement over the current precision and indicates that \\textsuperscript{101}Sn is less bound than previously thought. Mass predictions from a recently developed Bayesian model combination (BMC) framework employing statistical machine learning and nuclear masses computed within seven global models based on nuclear Density Functional Theory (DFT) agree within 1$\\sigma$ with experimental masses from the $48 \\le Z \\le 52$ isotopic chains.

      "summary": "arXiv:2510.11946v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: In this paper, we show that the chiral soliton lattice (ChSL) is, in a precise sense, a universal feature of the low-energy limit of QCD minimally coupled to Maxwell theory. Here, we disclose that not only can the ChSL be obtained from the gauged Skyrme model in $3+1$ dimensions, including the back-reaction of the Maxwell $U(1)$ gauge field, we also show that the ChSL remains unchanged if the sub-leading corrections to the Skyrme model in the 't Hooft large $N_c$ expansion are included. Taking into account the highly non-linear character of such corrections, this is quite a surprising result. By considering a suitable ansatz adapted to describe topological solitons at finite baryon density in a constant magnetic field, the generalized Skyrme model coupled to the Maxwell theory is reduced to the effective Lagrangian of the ChSL phase, describing a lattice of domain walls made of hadrons. One of the key points in this construction is the fact that even when the usual topological charge density vanishes, the presence of the Callan-Witten term in the topological charge density allows for a non-vanishing baryon number. In the present approach, the magnetic field can be external, as is usually assumed for the ChSL, or it can be self-consistently generated by the hadronic layers themselves. Finally, we show how our formulation allows us to study the coupling of the chiral soliton lattice with quark matter."

In studies of magnetic transport, for example in magnetic diffusion, the conservation of energy and momentum is then neglected. In this paper, we investigate the details and the consistency of this so-called $\\textit{probe limit}$ in different parametric regimes of MHD plasmas. In the first part of the paper, our discussion explores the hydrodynamic (higher-form) theory of MHD. In the second part, we then explicitly test the probe limit by using a microscopic holographic (AdS/CFT) model of a strongly coupled plasma. In the process, we develop the holographic Schwinger-Keldysh EFT prescription for describing the bulk 2-form fields and their dual 1-form symmetries. Moreover, we find evidence of a phase transition at low temperatures and show that magnetic Hall transport can emerge as a consequence of background charge density that breaks the charge conjugation symmetry of the state. Finally, we discuss the implications for magnetic transport, with a particular view towards the dynamics of dense nuclear matter in neutron stars."

This initial state spatial configuration has been used in the past to describe data on baryon rapidity distributions, diffractive $J/\\psi$ production and multiplicity distributions in pp collisions. In spite of its success in explaining the data, the evidence of the baryon junction still needs confirmation. Further studies will be undertaken at the electron-ion collider. In this work we study multiplicity distributions measured in pPb collisions. Different initial state geometries are used as input in a Monte Carlo event generator which implements the $k_T$-factorization formalism of the CGC with KLN unintegrated gluon distributions. The results indicate that the hard-sphere and Gaussian proton configurations are incompatible with the data. In contrast, the baryon junction configuration can describe the data provided that intrinsic fluctuations of the saturation scale are included."

      "summary": "Recent CDF II collaboration’s result on W mass measurements contradict Standard Model (SM) prediction, requiring new physics to explain this anomaly. Such new physics may manifest through tree-level or loop-level corrections to the mass of the W boson. In this work, we investigate the possibility that the CDF-II result is indicative of new physics not directly changing the W boson mass but rather the Z boson mass. Since the Z boson mass goes as an input into the SM prediction for W boson mass, this change in Z mass ultimately leads to the discrepancy between the CDF-II measurement and the SM expectation. We demonstrate this idea through one of the simplest and most studied U(1) gauge extensions of the SM, namely the gauged U(1)B−L extension. We demonstrate that B − L extended models can explain the revised best-fit values for S, T, and U following the CDF II results. We studied the parameter space of models with and without mixing between neutral gauge bosons. We also reviewed the dark matter constraints and demonstrated that there is parameter space that is compatible with the current W boson mass, relic abundance, and direct detection experiments."
