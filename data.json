The mirror-skin thickness of $ N = 20 $ isotones and $ Z = 20 $ isotopes is studied by using Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) calculations with various Skyrme EDFs and adding CSB and charge independence breaking (CIB) terms. It is shown that the mirror-skin thickness is sensitive only to the CSB EDF, but hardly depends on either the isospin symmetric part of the nuclear EDF or the CIB term. Therefore, this observable can be used to extract the magnitude of the CSB term in the EDF quantitatively, either from experimental data or ab initio calculations. We have studied the accuracy in the mirror-skin thickness that is needed to extract sensible information. Our study may also help to understand the inconsistency between the strength of the phenomenological CSB and that extracted from ab initio calculations [Naito et al. Nuovo. Cim. C 47, 52 (2024)]. Among possible mirror pairs for experimental study, we propose the mirror-skin thickness between $ {}^{42} \\mathrm{Ca} $ and $ {}^{42} \\mathrm{Ti} $, which could be accessed in future experiments in RIBF and/or FRIB."

PHSD is a microscopic, non-equilibrium approach that integrates hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom, providing a comprehensive description of relativistic heavy-ion collisions from initial nucleon-nucleon interactions to quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation, hadronization, and final-state interactions. Key dilepton sources in PHSD include hadronic decays, bremsstrahlung, QGP radiation ($q+\\bar q \\to e^+e^-$, \\ $q+\\bar q \\to g+ e^+e^-$, \\ $q+g \\to q+ e^+e^-$), primary Drell-Yan production, and semileptonic decays of correlated charm and bottom pairs. PHSD well describes dilepton data from HADES, STAR, and ALICE experiments. We examine in-medium effects, such as the vector meson spectral function broadening, and present the excitation function for the dilepton \"excess\" in the invariant mass range $0.4<0.75$ GeV/c$^2$. For the first time we report on the baryon chemical potential $\\mu_B$-dependence of the QGP radiation calculated on a basis of the Dynamical-Quasi-Particle Model (DQPM) in PHSD. The influence of $\\mu_B$ on the QGP yield grows at lower collision energies, where $\\mu_B$ becomes large, however, its impact on the total dilepton spectra is small due to the lowering of the QGP volume with decreasing energy. The excitation function of QGP dileptons, is presented versus correlated charm, confirming that the QGP radiation overshines charm contributions at $\\sqrt{s} \\simeq 25-30$ GeV in central Au+Au collisions, providing access to thermal QGP dileptons at BES RHIC and FAIR."

This leads to a more realistic description of nuclear partition function which poses one of the largest uncertainties in the mass fraction calculations under conditions of NSE. The Coulomb correction term was taken into account for the calculation of ground state binding energies of the nucleons.

Geant4 is a powerful simulation tool for nuclear physics studies, but it does not handle multiple initial particles in a single simulation instance, nor does it feature high fidelity fission sampling. JANGOFETT: A Novel Geant4-Operated Fission Event Tracking Tool has been developed to address this challenge. The tool utilizes simulated fission data from an external program in conjunction with Geant4, which has been modified to produce a single timeline of events over an entire simulated experiment. The physical accuracy of the simulated overlapping energy depositions within detectors has been verified via simulation of fission products from the spontaneous fission of 252Cf."

The excitation energy spectrum above the $t$+$t$ threshold in $^{6}$He is measured via the fragmentation excitation process during the breakup reaction of $^{9}$Li on a $^{208}$Pb target at an incident energy of 32.7 MeV/nucleon. The resonant states are reconstructed from the final state coincident particles $t$+$t$ using the invariant mass method, while the non-resonant background is estimated using the event mixing method. The two new states of energy level peaks at $17.016\\pm0.002$ and $19.4\\pm0.6$ MeV are observed in addition to the previously observed energy level peaks at $13.9\\pm0.3$ and $15.0\\pm0.3$ MeV.

We then show that the presence of such a potential is necessarily connected with a large uncertainty in the reconstructed energy. This same uncertainty also affects the determination of energy- and four-momentum-transfers in neutrino-nucleus reactions. We analyze the origins of these uncertainties using transport theory for the description of the evolution of the final state of the reaction.
