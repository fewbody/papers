EscherThe zirconium isotopes exhibit structural properties that present multiple challenges to nuclear theory. Investigations of the coupling present within isoscalar modes and within isovector modes are scarce but important for advancing our understanding of the microscopic picture of nuclei. To explore …[Phys. Rev. C 111, 054314] Published Fri May 16, 2025"

      "summary": "Author(s): Jing Ye and Wei-Zhou JiangThe zero-sound modes at finite temperature are investigated with the relativistic random phase approximation to signal the uncertainty of the equation of state (EOS) of asymmetrical nuclear matter. It is observed that in typically selected stiff and soft relativistic mean-field (RMF) models, zero-so…[Phys. Rev. C 111, 054315] Published Fri May 16, 2025"

It offers a very systematical ranking of the significance of nuclear-structure observables in reaction calculations. This greatly helps to infer reliable structure …[Phys. Rev.
