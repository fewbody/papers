By taking into account both the intrinsic electromagnetic structure of nucleons and the zero-point motions of nuclear shape, which have been often neglected in previous studies, the similar charge radii of $^{40}$Ca and $^{48}$Ca as well as an inverted parabolic behavior between them are reproduced. It is found that these effects also play crucial roles in the description of the isotonic shift between the charge radii of Sn and Cd isotopes."

In this letter, we report a systematic analysis of two-body dissipation effects on the validity of mean-field dynamics, enabled by the TDHF-QRx approach, which incorporates the collision term via the relaxation-time approximation rather than full collision calculations. For deep-inelastic reactions, the contact time between nuclei is found to increase, resulting in changes to the reaction process and fragment properties such as scattering angles and total kinetic energy. These changes become important with the increase of reaction energy and decrease of impact parameter. We identify the range of reaction condition where two-body dissipation becomes significant, providing valuable insights for the applicability of mean-field dynamics approaches. The limitations of model, particularly those arising from the incomplete conservation of the locality of two-body dissipation within the quantum framework, are also discussed."

Concentrating on nuclei with a 0$^+$ ground state from $^4$He through $^{48}$Ca, we investigate the off-shell character of their one-body density matrices in momentum space when using the momentum transfer and the average momentum as variables. A singular value decomposition of the one-body density matrices reveals that they can be characterized by only very few terms, depending on the mass number of the nucleus. These findings are independent of the nucleon-nucleon interactions employed, as well as from computational specifics as grid spacing and size of the model space."

      "summary": "arXiv:2508.09298v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Effective interaction models of quantum chromodynamics, based on quark degrees of freedom, have been successfully employed to compute the properties of a large array of ground and excited meson and baryon states, along with their electromagnetic form factors, distribution functions and thermal behavior. Amongst them, the contact-interaction model, while non-renormalizable, implements confinement, satisfies Lorentz covariance and correctly describes chiral symmetry and its dynamical breaking pattern. Original studies focused on the light hadron sector in the isospin limit and were thereafter extended to heavy mesons and baryons. The strong effective couplings, as well as infrared and ultraviolet regulators, are flavor-dependent model parameters adjusted to reproduce hadronic observables. In contrast, in this study we combine SU(4) flavor-symmetry breaking couplings, obtained from one-loop vacuum polarization amplitudes in the presence of background constituent quark currents, with the contact-interaction model. This allows us to reduce the number of mass-dimensioned parameters and to consistently relate all flavored couplings to a single mass scale, while the masses and weak decay constants of the pions, kaons, $D$ and $D_s$ mesons are in good agreement with average reference values. Allowing for realistic isospin breaking, $m_d/m_u = 1.7$, in conjunction with the effect of the flavored couplings, leads to a mass splitting, $m_{\\pi^+}- m_{\\pi^0} \\approx 0.3$ MeV, that agrees with lattice QCD values. For the kaons, the mass difference is $m_{K^0}- m_{K^\\pm} \\approx 2.3$ MeV, whereas $m_{D^\\pm} - m_{D^0} \\approx 0.5$ MeV and the $\\eta_c$ is 6\\% lighter than the experimental mass."

The Coulomb explosion of deuterium clusters is simulated based on the particle-in-cell model in a box system with periodic boundary conditions, and fusion reactions are incorporated through the stochastic method. As long as the deuteron numbers in deuterium clusters follow a log-normal distribution, the low-energy part of the final deuteron spectrum can be fitted by a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, while there are more deuterons in the intermediate- and high-energy region compared to a thermal distribution, and dominate the weighted yield ratio. Therefore, the effective temperature extracted from the weighted yield ratio is generally higher than that from fitting the final deuteron spectrum. The local density fluctuation, which intrinsically exists due to the log-normal distribution of deuteron numbers, further enhances hot deuteron-deuteron collisions, and significantly affects the weighted yield ratio."

      "summary": "arXiv:2508.09474v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Within the framework of the generalized linear sigma model, a comprehensive analysis of scalar and pseudoscalar glueballs and their mixing with mesons is presented. The Lagrangian of the model contains two chiral nonets, a quark-antiquark type and a two-quark two-antiquark type. The pseudoscalar and scalar glueballs are introduced through their connections with the axial and the trace anomalies of QCD, respectively. It is found that in order to satisfy the axial anomaly and at the same time accurately generate all seven eta masses, it is necessary to include at least two pseudoscalar glueballs, a physical one and an unphysical one that gets integrated out and yields an effective instanton-type term which is needed in generation of the eta masses. At the leading order, which corresponds to keeping effective terms in the Lagrangian that contain no more than eight underlying quarks and antiquarks, the mass spectrum of the model is worked out and shown to be in complete agreement with experiment. The quark and glue contents of the isosinglet scalars below 2 GeV, and of the isosinglet pseudoscalars up to around 2.2 GeV, are analyzed in detail and their correlations with the scalar glueball condensate are examined. Decay widths of isosinglet scalars as well as different self consistencies within this framework are used to probe the glueball condensate and thereby estimate the quark and glue contents of these states. In the pseudoscalar sector, the state that is dominantly made of glue is clearly a state with mass above 2 GeV. In the scalar sector, the identification of glue contents is less certain and in principle the three isosinglets in the 1.5-2.0 GeV can contain substantial glue. These glue contents are determined as functions of the scalar glueball condensate which is the key quantity in this analysis."

However, in many cases electric-quadrupole observables, which are a particularly sensitive probe of collectivity, remain undetermined. Coulomb-excitation measurements were performed to measure transition strengths connecting the ground and low-excitation states in $^{124}$Te. This isotope lies at a transitional point between collective structure near the neutron midshell and seniority structures near the $N=82$ shell. A transition strength, $B(E2; 6_1^+ \\to 4_1^+)$, of 27(9)~W.u. was measured for the $6^+_1\\rightarrow4^+_1$ transition for the first time in this nucleus; this value is significantly below that expected for a spherical vibrator, as well as other collective models. We examine the transition strengths in $^{124}$Te and its neighbors by comparison with large-basis shell-model calculations and by comparison with General Collective Model (GCM) fits. A GCM description of $^{120}$Te agrees with experimental $E2$ transition strengths, but no comparable description of $^{124}$Te is possible with the GCM. In contrast, there is remarkably good agreement between the $B(E2; 6_1^+ \\to 4_1^+)$ values and shell-model calculations for $^{124-134}$Te. It appears that, despite approaching midshell, $^{124}$Te retains a seniority structure for the $6^+_1$ level, i.e. a significant $\\pi 0g_{7/2}^2$ contribution. This persistence of the shell structure at the $6^+_1$ state is in contrast to the $B(E2)$ values of the lower-excitation $2^+_1$ and $4^+_1$ states in $^{124}$Te, and neighboring $^{120}$Te and $^{122}$Te, for which the collectivity becomes enhanced as more neutrons are removed from $N=82$."

Despite the fact that similar transitions can be excited by plane-wave photons, twisted photons with $|m_\\gamma|>1$ enable the isolation of higher multipoles offering a unique spectroscopic tool. The fulfillment of the derived selection rules imposes constraints on the parameters of the wave packet of the quarkonium center of mass, since, in general, the angular momentum can be transferred to the center of mass.

Furthermore, scattering in scalar field theory has been shown to be BQP-complete, making it a representative problem for which quantum computation is efficient. As a step toward large-scale quantum simulations of collision processes, scattering of wavepackets in one-dimensional scalar field theory is simulated using 120 qubits of IBM's Heron superconducting quantum computer ibm_fez. Variational circuits compressing vacuum preparation, wavepacket initialization, and time evolution are determined using classical resources. By leveraging physical properties of states in the theory, such as symmetries and locality, the variational quantum algorithm constructs scalable circuits that can be used to simulate arbitrarily-large system sizes. A new strategy is introduced to mitigate errors in quantum simulations, which enables the extraction of meaningful results from circuits with up to 4924 two-qubit gates and two-qubit gate depths of 103. The effect of interactions is clearly seen, and is found to be in agreement with classical Matrix Product State simulations. The developments that will be necessary to simulate high-energy inelastic collisions on a quantum computer are discussed."

      "summary": "We investigate the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator for a spin-1/2 particle using the Pauli equation in a $$(2+1)$$-dimensional topologically charged Perry-Mann-type wormhole spacetime with cosmic string-type disclinations. The angular component of the Pauli spinor is a two-component plane wave. The radial differential equation includes relativistic corrections through spin-orbit coupling terms and the Darwin term. We derive the exact radial wave function expressed in terms of the Heun polynomial, along with the quantized energy levels and oscillation frequencies, incorporating corrections from spin-orbit coupling, the Darwin term, and topological effects in all cases. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of the cosmic string, global monopole, and spacetime curvature by graphically analyzing the eigenenergies and radial probability density."
