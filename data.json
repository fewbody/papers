      "summary": "arXiv:2505.08879v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Nucleons are known to form pairing correlations with various types of spin-symmetries. Spin-singlet neutron-neutron and proton-proton pairing is abundant in the nuclear chart but spin-triplet and mixed-spin proton-neutron pairing correlations have also been predicted to form at least in the ground states of certain nuclei. A realistic candidate region is that of the lightest Lanthanides where it was recently demonstrated that the nuclear deformation expected to emerge enhances spin-triplet pairing correlations. In this paper we provide the details of the deformed multimodal Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov theory that lead to this conclusion, as well as the details of the effects identified. We present in detail the response of different pairing correlations to various deformation modes and calculate their signatures in the odd-even staggering of masses. This paper provides a detailed discussion, and some resolutions, on the long-standing question ``what is the effect of nuclear deformation on the various pairing correlations?''"

      "summary": "arXiv:2505.09299v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present an improved action for Pionless Effective Field Theory (EFT). Previous formulations of renormalizable nuclear EFTs have encountered instabilities in systems with more than four nucleons. We resolve this issue by introducing a finite interaction range at leading order, which is compensated for in perturbation theory at next-to-leading order. Calculated ground-state energies of $^4$He, $^6$Li, $^{12}$C, and $^{16}$O converge and agree with experiment within theoretical uncertainties. This first successful implementation of systematic renormalizability beyond the lightest nuclei enables not only applications to larger nuclei but also extensions to other EFTs in the strong-coupling regime."

      "summary": "arXiv:2505.09348v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present a theoretical investigation of photonuclear tomography as a novel technique for probing the internal structure of nuclei. In this approach, ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions (UPCs) serve as a source of intense fluxes of virtual photons, which induce coherent production of vector mesons. By analyzing the probabilities and cross sections of these photon-induced processes, we propose a methodology for reconstructing the spatial distribution of nucleons within the nucleus. Our framework provides a systematic way to access information on the nuclear geometry probed in UPCs, offering new opportunities for studies of nuclear structure using particle production as a probe. Numerical calculations for selected examples illustrate the feasibility and potential of this method."

      "summary": "arXiv:2505.09190v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We investigate the effects of dark matter (DM) on neutron star (NS) properties using the neutron decay anomaly model within the relativistic mean-field (RMF) framework. Three nucleonic models (HCD0-HCD2) are developed, satisfying astrophysical constraints such as the maximum NS mass ($\\geq 2 M_\\odot$), the NICER mass-radius limits, and the tidal deformability constraint from the GW170817 event. The equation of states of the NS admixed with DM (DMANS) are calculated by incorporating the self-interactions between them. The macroscopic properties, such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability of the NSs, are obtained for HCD models along with five others by varying self-interaction strength. By combining NS observations with scattering cross-section constraints from galaxy clusters, we explore model-dependent trends in the DM self-interaction parameter space. While the quantitative bounds may vary with hadronic model choice, our analysis offers insights into the interplay between DM interactions and NS observables within the RMF framework."

      "summary": "arXiv:2505.09245v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Introduction: Neutrons are produced when photons interact with parts of the accelerator, materials in the treatment room, or the patient's body. These neutrons have significant biological effects due to their high quality factor, potentially leading to secondary cancers. Material and method: A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted using the MCNPX code to model an Elekta Infinity linear accelerator operating at 18 MV. The accelerator was situated inside a bunker measuring 7.4* 5 m2. To study photoneutron production and the effectiveness of shielding, various concrete mixtures were applied to the walls of the maze and treatment room. Results: Regardless of the modifications, both photon and neutron fluence decreased substantially as the distance from the maze entrance increased. The fluence reduction was more pronounced between the maze entrance and center. The lowest equivalent neutron doses behind the treatment room door were observed when Ord-Lim concrete was used, while the highest doses occurred with Gal-Bar concrete. Conclusion: The configuration of concrete layers within the treatment room and maze walls is a key factor influencing the changes in neutron dose behind the treatment room door. These variations result from differences in concrete composition and the way neutrons are absorbed in different setups."

The rank-one separable kernel of the quark-antiquark interaction is used to solve the equation analytically. Multidimensional integrals describing pion properties are calculated by several numerical methods and compared with previous papers. An error in the calculation of the interaction part of the elastic pion form factor is found. Using the corrected results, the kernel parameters are refitted. The calculated static properties as well as transition and elastic form factors are presented in comparison with the recent experimental data."

      "summary": "arXiv:2501.02646v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: High-order virtual excitations play an important role in microscopic models of nuclear reactions at intermediate energies. However, the factorial growth of their complexity has prevented their consistent inclusion in ab initio many-body calculations. For infinite systems at finite temperature, such drawbacks can be overcome using diagrammatic Monte Carlo techniques to resum entire series of Feynman diagrams. We present a diagrammatic Monte Carlo algorithm that can be applied to self-bound systems with discrete energy levels at zero temperature, and demonstrate its potential for the Richardson model of nuclear pairing. We show that sampling the topological space of diagrams allows the inclusion of high-order excitations that are neglected in state-of-the-art approximations used in nuclear physics and quantum chemistry. We propose that sampling the diagrammatic space can overcome the long-standing gap between our microscopic understanding of structure and reactions in nuclear physics."

      "summary": "arXiv:2412.18308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The 229Th nucleus possesses a unique low-frequency transition at 8.4 eV, which is being considered for the development of an extremely accurate nuclear clock. We investigate an electronic bridge process in the Th III ion, where nuclear excitation occurs via electronic transitions, and demonstrate that a proper choice of laser frequencies can lead to 10,000 enhancement of this effect. Electrons also reduce 1.7 times the lifetime of the nuclear excited state.\n  Additionally, the electronic structure of the Th III ion exhibits features that make it particularly useful for probing new physics. Notably, it contains a metastable state connected to the ground state via a weak M2 transition, which can be utilized for quantum information processing, as well as searches for oscillating axion field, violation of local Lorentz invariance, test of the Einstein's equivalence principle, and measurement of nuclear weak quadrupole moment. The electronic states of the ion present a unique case of level crossing involving the 5f, 6d, and 7s single-electron states. This crossing renders the transition frequencies highly sensitive to potential time-variation of the fine-structure constant."

      "summary": "arXiv:2501.19349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: In this work, we have studied, for the first time, the impact of a realistic picture of a time dependent electric and magnetic field on the shear and bulk viscosities of the medium. Both the electric and magnetic fields are considered to be exponentially decaying with time, and the study is valid in the regime where the magnetic field strength is weak ($eB\\ll T^2$). The evaluation has been done in the kinetic theory framework wherein we have solved the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation within the relaxation time approximation collision kernel. We have shown that the constant weak field results as well as the $B=0$ results in the literature can be obtained as special cases of our general results. We have observed that the shear and bulk viscosities increase with time or equivalently, decrease with the strength of the magnetic field. To connect these observations with experiments, we have calculated the thermalization time, shear viscosity to entropy ratio ($\\eta /s$), and bulk viscosity to entropy ratio ($\\zeta /s$)."
