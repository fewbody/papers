James, Samantha R. Johnson, Richard Longland, Antonella Saracino, Nirupama Sensharma, Kaixin Song, and Clay WegnerRecent observations of red giant stars in a globular cluster in the outer halo of the Milky Way revealed a puzzling anomaly in the abundance of chemical elements that cannot be explained by common cluster evolution models. The authors use nuclear resonance fluorescence, a powerful method for determining the spins and parities of astrophysically relevant nuclear resonances, to selectively photoexcite several low-lying levels in 31P that would be challenging to access with traditional reaction techniques. Using the TUNL High-Intensity Gammaray Source, the authors unambiguously determined the orbital angular momentum transfers of two previously unobserved resonances at Erc.m.=18.7 keV and 50.5 keV. The measured thermonuclear reaction rate differs by about an order of magnitude from earlier estimates at temperatures of T≤200 MK relevant for globular cluster nucleosynthesis. The new results put crucial constraints on the reaction mechanism correcting assumptions from previous work and could have broader implications for nucleosynthesis in certain stellar populations.[Phys.

      "summary": "arXiv:2508.10420v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: A triaxial relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (TRHBc) has been developed to incorporate triaxial deformation, pairing correlations, and continuum effects in a fully microscopic and self-consistent way, aiming for a reliable description of triaxial exotic nuclei with extreme neutron-to-proton ratios. The TRHBc formalism is presented in detail, and its numerical implementation is benchmarked against the results from the axially deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum and the TRHB theory in harmonic oscillator expansion. The TRHBc theory is applied to investigate the aluminum isotopes systematically, and the available data are well reproduced for the binding energies, one- and two-neutron separation energies, and charge radii. The nuclei near the one-neutron drip line, $^{40}$Al and $^{42}$Al, are found to be triaxially deformed with one-neutron separation energies below 1 MeV. Possible neutron halos in the triaxial nuclei $^{40}$Al and $^{42}$Al are explored by examining the single-particle levels around the Fermi surface, including their composition and contribution to the total neutron density. The existence of neutron halos in $^{40}$Al and $^{42}$Al is also supported by the halo scale, which is comparable to other halo nuclei well-established previously. More importantly, the mechanism for the halo formation in $^{40}$Al is revealed to be the triaxial deformation, which results in the decoupling of the halo orbitals from those of the core."

High-precision measurements of nuclear charge densities to extract higher-order moments are proposed to be sensitive to neutron radii and skin thicknesses. We investigate the charge density of $^{48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb, leading candidates for such studies, with ab initio nuclear structure calculations. We find strong correlations between the fourth-order charge density moment $R_\\mathrm{ch}^4$ and the charge and neutron radii, allowing us to predict $R_\\mathrm{ch}^4$ for $^{48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb. We find a substantially weaker correlation between the fourth-order charge density moment and the neutron skin, limiting the ability of high-precision electron scattering to determine the neutron skin in a model-independent manner."

This result and constraints from Gauss's law are used to prove that weakly-coupled pNRQCD van der Waals potentials in generic non-Abelian gauge theories with only heavy quarks are too weak to form bound states whose color state is a product of color-singlets. Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of four, five, and six quarks with equal masses provide numerical evidence that exotic color configurations are higher energy than products of color-singlet hadrons, suggesting that equal-mass fully-heavy tetraquark, pentaquark, and hexaquark bound states do not exist at next-to-leading order in pNRQCD and at all orders in QCD-like theories in which all quark masses are asymptotically large. Mechanisms for generating hadron-hadron bound states are identified, which necessarily involve large quark-mass hierarchies, relativistic effects arising from the presence of sufficiently light quarks, or nonperturbative effects outside the scope of weakly-coupled pNRQCD."

Here, we report an updated implementation of the spectral function approach in the \\nuwro{} Monte Carlo generator, which consistently treats multinucleon final-states in quasielastic scattering at the inclusive and exclusive level. After validating its accuracy against inclusive electron-scattering data, we compare its predictions to various neutrino cross sections from MicroBooNE. We find that with the multinucleon contribution, these data are reproduced with $\\chi^2$ per degree of freedom of 1.3--1.8, compared to 2.7--7.2 without it."

This goes beyond the known hard-collinear diffractive factorization to address the small-$x$ Regge dynamics and Pomeron exchange from first principles. The effective field theory analysis also uncovers and factorizes an important irreducible incoherent background generated by color-nonsinglet exchange, dubbed \"quasi-diffraction\", for which we calculate the associated Sudakov suppression. For unpolarized scattering we show that there are four diffractive structure functions at leading power, and point out the importance of studying $F_{3,4}^D$ through asymmetries, in addition to $F_{2,L}^D$. For the quasi-diffractive background, we make model independent predictions for ratios of the corresponding structure functions in a perturbative kinematic region. Our analysis also makes predictions for six leading-power spin-dependent structure functions. Finally, we provide connections to diffractive parton distributions, and assess the Ingelman-Schlein model. Our work lays a path for further QCD-based studies of diffraction."

The charm quark is implemented with a relativistic heavy-quark action at its physical mass. Employing the time-dependent HAL QCD method, the $N$-$\\Omega_{\\mathrm{ccc}}$ potentials in the spin-1 ($^3\\mathrm{S}_1$) and spin-2 ($^5\\mathrm{S}_2$) channels are extracted. In both channels, overall attraction is found with the scattering parameters, $a_0 = 0.56(0.13)\\left(^{+0.26}_{-0.03}\\right)$ fm and $r_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1.60(0.05)\\left(^{+0.04}_{-0.12}\\right)$ fm for the $^3\\mathrm{S}_1$ channel, and\n  $a_0 = 0.38(0.12)\\left(^{+0.25}_{-0.00}\\right)$ fm and $r_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 2.04(0.10)\\left(^{+0.03}_{-0.22}\\right)$ fm for the $^5\\mathrm{S}_2$ channel, indicating the absence of a dibaryon bound state. The extracted potentials are further decomposed into spin-independent and spin-dependent components. The spin-independent potential is a dominant component and features a short-range attractive core and a long-range attractive tail, while the spin-dependent potential shows short-range attraction (repulsion) in the spin-1 (spin-2) channel. Qualitative comparisons with previous studies of the $N$-$J/\\psi$ and $N$-$\\Omega_{\\rm{sss}}$ systems at $m_\\pi \\simeq 146$ MeV are provided, emphasizing the role of heavy-hadron chromo-polarizability arising from soft-gluon exchange between the nucleon and flavor-singlet hadrons. The charm quark mass dependence of the $N$-$\\Omega_{\\rm ccc}$ potential is investigated as well."

Related problems leading to integration order dependent results are even further pronounced in the presence of additional scales such as external momenta. This plays a noticeable role in systems featuring fermionic degrees of freedom such as cold Quantum Chromodynamics, where loop integrals are complexified by chemical potential(s). Working in the limit of vanishing temperature, we utilize novel complex-valued extensions to bubble Feynman integrals and study momentum expansions of fermionic loop integrals. The expansions are then used to illustrate the mechanisms of manifested discrepancies between orders of integration, associated with the residue theorem. Finally, we address the issues by introducing a representation avoiding the observed ambiguity and briefly overview classes of integrals insensitive to problems from external momenta."

The different descriptions we use to describe matter microscopically contain varying particle degrees of freedom, including nucleons, hyperons, Delta baryons, and light and strange quarks. We use tabulated equations of state from the CompOSE database in which the quark deconfinement phase transition is described as being first-order, and then smooth it out by introducing a percolation, replacing the single first-order phase transition with two transitions of second or third order. We then perform binary neutron-star merger simulations using these new equations of st ate, focusing on groups of binaries with the same single-star mass, radius, and tidal deformability, but different equations of state. We go on to discuss differences in their evolution, and the ramifications for interpreting future gravitational wave observations and the potential to learn about dense matter."

The gradient surface terms of the NS energy density $\\cal{E}(\\rho)$ [Equation of State] are taken into account along with the volume ones at the leading order of the leptodermic parameter $a/R << 1$, where $a$ is the ES crust thickness and $R$ is the mean NS radius.

The NS MI, $\\Theta=\\tilde{\\Theta}/(1-\\cal{G}_{t\\varphi})$, was obtained in terms of the statistically averaged MI, $\\tilde{\\Theta}$, and its time and azimuthal-angle correlation, $\\cal{G}_{t\\varphi}$, as sums of the volume and surface components. The MI $\\Theta$ depends dramatically on its effective radius $R$ because of strong gravitation and surface effects.

The partonic spectrum of $pp$ collisions with next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV is provided by the POWHEG$+$PYTHIA8 event generator, while the linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model is utilized to investigate the energy loss of fast partons as they traverse through the hot and dense QCD medium. We present the jet broadening distributions in multijet final states for both $pp$ and PbPb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV, then observe an enhancement at the small jet broadening region and suppression at the large jet broadening region in PbPb collisions relative to that in $pp$. This suggests that medium modification with parton energy loss in the QGP leads to a more concentrated energy flow in all observed multijet events in PbPb reactions. We also demonstrate that the intertwining of two effects, the jet number reduction and the restructured contribution, results in the novel behavior of nuclear modification of the jet broadening observable in PbPb collisions."

For a broad subclass of physical many-body mixed Gaussian states, including the free scalar field vacuum, the logarithmic negativity is here shown to be a necessary and sufficient measure of entanglement and to be entirely accessible by pairs of single-mode detectors in the continuum. By deriving exact and optimal detection profiles, entanglement resources in the massive field are demonstrated to be available at all distances."
