Epistemic uncertainties arising from training the same network multiple times for an ensemble of initial weight sets offer a first insight into the confidence of machine learning predictions, but they often come with a high computational cost. Instead, we apply a single-model uncertainty quantification method called {\\Delta}-UQ that gives epistemic uncertainties with one-time training. We demonstrate our approach on a 2-feature model of nuclear binding energies per nucleon with proton and neutron number pairs as inputs. We show that {\\Delta}-UQ can produce reliable and self-consistent epistemic uncertainty estimates and can be used to assess the degree of confidence in predictions made with deep neural networks."

      "summary": "arXiv:2504.09148v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Magic numbers lie at the heart of nuclear structure, reflecting enhanced stability in nuclei with closed shells. While the emergence of magic numbers beyond 20 is commonly attributed to strong spin-orbit coupling, the microscopic origin of the spin-orbit potential remains elusive, owing to its dependence on the resolution scale and renormalization scheme of nuclear forces. Here, we investigate the evolution of shell structure with varying momentum resolution in nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory, using the similarity renormalization group, which provides a fundamental framework for linking different scales. We uncover a universal transition from spin symmetry to pseudospin symmetry as the resolution scale decreases, during which magic numbers emerge naturally. A similar pattern is found in calculations using relativistic one-boson-exchange potentials, underscoring the robustness of the phenomenon. This work establishes a direct connection between realistic nuclear forces with a high resolution scale and effective nuclear forces at coarse-grained scales, offering a first-principles explanation for the origin of magic numbers and pseudospin symmetry in nuclear shell structure, and new insights into the structure of exotic nuclei far from stability."

Previous simulation studies suggest that lepton capture (LC) rates on isotopes of vanadium have a substantial effect in regulating the electron fraction (Ye) during the final evolutionary phases. The present work involves the calculation of LC rates for 22 isotopes of vanadium using the proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA) model. The considered mass range is from A = 43 to 64. The LC rates are computed over stellar densities ranging from 10^1 to 10^11 g/cm^3 and temperatures in the range 10^7 to 3 x 10^10 K. A comparison of our LC rates with those obtained using other models (IPM and LSSM) is also presented. Compared to other models, the pn-QRPA rates at high temperature (3 x 10^10 K) are larger by 1-2 orders of magnitude."

Previous simulation results show that weak rates on isotopes of Molybdenum (Mo) have a meaningful contribution during the development of phases of stars before they go supernova. The relative abundance, coupled with the stellar weak rates on Mo isotopes, may change the lepton-to-baryon content of the core material. Here, we report on the calculation of nuclear structure properties of Mo isotopes from mass number 82 to 138, employing the RMF model. Later, we calculate the weak decay rates of these isotopes using the proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA) model. In the first step, the ground-state nuclear properties of Mo isotopes such as binding energy per nucleon, neutron and proton separation energies, charge radii, total electric quadrupole moments, and the deformation parameter of electric quadrupole moments have been calculated using the density-dependent version of the RMF model with DD-PC1 and DD-ME2 functionals. The calculated electric quadrupole deformation parameters have been used in a deformed pn-QRPA calculation in the second phase of this work to calculate half-lives and weak decay rates for these Mo isotopes in stellar matter. We calculate the electron capture and beta-decay rates over an extensive range of temperature (0.01 x 10^9 K to 30 x 10^9 K) and density (10 to 10^11 g/cm^3).

In this work, we propose a hybrid treatment for investigating the clustering phenomenon in nuclear medium, where clusters ranging from light nuclei (e.g., $^3$H, $^3$He, and $^4$He) to heavy ones (e.g., $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca, $^{48}$Ca, and $^{208}$Pb) can be treated in a unified manner. In particular, assuming a spherical Wigner-Seitz cell, the clusters are fixed by solving the Dirac equations imposing the Dirichlet-Neumann boundary condition, while the nuclear medium are treated with Thomas-Fermi approximation and take constant densities. In the presence of nuclear medium, the clusters eventually become unbound as density increases, while the root-mean-square charge radii increase. For clusters with different proton and neutron numbers $N_p \\neq N_n$, their binding energies varies with the proton fraction of nuclear medium, which are less significant for clusters with $N_p = N_n$. The uncertainties of density functionals on the clustering phenomenon are investigated as well adopting 8 different functionals. Based on the obtained results, an analytical formula describing the binding energies of in-medium clusters is then obtained. The results presented in this work should be useful to understand the clustering phenomenon in both heavy-ion collisions and neutron stars."

Although the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) method provides a reasonable description of average reaction outcomes and one-body dissipation, it is known to significantly underestimate fluctuations of observables. The purpose of this work is to investigate deep-inelastic collisions of 144Sm+144Sm and 154Sm+154Sm with microscopic mean-field approaches and to show a predominant role of one-body dissipation as well as one-body fluctuations and correlation in low-energy heavy-ion reactions. Three dimensional TDHF calculations are carried out for 144Sm+144Sm at Ecm=500 MeV and 154Sm+154Sm at Ecm=485 MeV for a range of impact parameters with Skyrme SLy5 energy density functional. Backward time evolutions are performed as well to evaluate fluctuations and correlation in nucleon numbers within time-dependent random phase approximation (TDRPA). With TDRPA we calculate mass- and charge-number fluctuations, as well as the correlation between neutron and proton transfers, for each impact parameter. We demonstrate that TDRPA quantitatively reproduces the experimental \\sigma_{AA}^2-TKEL distributions, whereas it systematically underestimates the charge fluctuation, \\sigma_{ZZ}. The double-differential cross sections of reaction products are calculated, showing good agreement with the experimental data. We confirm a long-thought characteristic property that the closed-shell structure limits nucleon transfer at small energy losses, based on our microscopic TDHF and TDRPA calculations."

Inspired by recent studies demonstrating that the abrupt change can be clearly observed in the charge radii of the scandium isotopic chain across the neutron number $N=20$, we further review the underlying mechanism of the enlarged charge radii for $^{42}$Sc based on the covariant density functional theory. The pairing correlations are tackled by solving the state-dependent Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer equations. Meanwhile, the neutron-proton correlation around the Fermi surface derived from the simultaneously unpaired proton and neutron is appropriately considered in describing the systematic evolution of nuclear charge radii. The calculated results suggest that the abrupt increase in charge radii across the $N=20$ shell closure seems to be improved along the scandium isotopic chain if the strong neutron-proton correlation is properly included."

Including the excitation of the 232Th inelastic shows significant coupling effects on the elastic scattering below the barrier energies compared to higher incident energies. Subsequently, the CDCC framework was used to analyze the nuclear, Coulomb, and total breakup predictions separately. The breakup cross sections for the 6Li+232Th system are greater than those for the 7Li+232Th system across various energies. The present study predicts destructive Coulomb-nuclear interference in the breakup processes involving both 6Li and 7Li projectile nuclei with the deformed 232Th target.

We present numerical evidence that for a large class of models, the large $n_f$ limit is not necessary: the same dynamical equations can describe the relaxation processes at high temperatures for a set of classical models inspired from mean-field treatments of interacting dense neutrino gases, up to times set by the radius of convergence of the perturbation series for the correlation function. After a simple rescaling of time, the dynamics display a surprising universality, being identical for any value of $n_f$ as long as the rank of the coupling matrix is small. As a corollary of our results, we find that the direct interaction approximation originating from the study of stochastic flows in fluid turbulence should be thought of as only a short-time approximation for generic random coupling systems."

The study of SPCs provides an independent method to understand the transport properties of the system formed in heavy-ion collisions. Similar to anisotropic flow coefficients, which are largely influenced by the initial spatial anisotropy, SPCs also depend upon the participant plane correlation measured using the participating nucleons of the collision overlap region. In this paper, SPCs have been studied in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV using the event generator AMPT. In addition to their behaviour with the changing centrality of the collision, their event shape dependence has also been studied for the first time, using the event shape classifier transverse spherocity. The Gaussian estimator has been used to evaluate the correlations, and these have been compared to the participant plane correlations defined in an analogous way to the symmetry plane correlations and a qualitative match has been found between them.

In the noncentral events of heavy-ion collisions, the produced medium can carry a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity. This rotation can significantly affect various properties, including viscous properties and the expansion of the QGP medium. Using a novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation at finite angular velocity, we have calculated the shear and bulk viscosities and compared them with their counterparts in the standard relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach. Our results show that the angular velocity increases both shear and bulk viscosities, suggesting an enhanced momentum transfer within the medium and greater fluctuations in local pressure. This rotational effect on viscosities is more evident at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. Our analysis also shows that, compared to the standard relaxation time approximation, the shear viscosity is lower while the bulk viscosity is higher in the novel relaxation time approximation for all temperatures. Additionally, some observables related to the flow characteristic, fluid behavior and conformal symmetry of the medium are markedly impacted due to rotation. We have also studied the hydrodynamic evolution of matter within the Bjorken boost-invariant scenario and have found that the energy density evolves faster in the presence of finite rotation than in the nonrotating case. Consequently, rapid rotation accelerates the cooling process of the QGP medium."

At the advent of QCD, an alternative hypothesis emerged suggesting, at high energies, the transport of a nucleon's baryon number could be traced by a non-perturbative configuration of gluon fields connecting its three valence quarks, forming a $Y$-shaped topology known as the gluon junction. Recent measurements by the STAR experiment are compatible with this scenario. In light of these measurements, this study aims to explore the mechanisms of baryon transport in high-energy nuclear collisions using the PYTHIA-8 framework, which incorporates a state-of-the-art hadronization model with advanced Color Flow (CF) and Color Reconnection (CR) mechanisms which mimic signatures of a baryon junction. Within this model setup, we investigate (i) the rapidity slope of the net-baryon distributions in photon-included processes ($\\gamma$+p) and (ii) baryon over charge transport in the isobaric (Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr) collisions. Our study highlights the importance of the CF and CR mechanisms in PYTHIA-8, which plays a crucial role in baryon transport. The results show that the CF and CR schemes significantly affect the isobaric baryon-to-charge ratio, leading to different predictions for baryon stopping and underscoring the need to account for CF and CR effects in comparisons with experimental measurements."

Focusing on the approximately back-to-back electroproduction of a hadron-electron pair, we apply transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization formulas that incorporate TMD evolution for both event-shape observables and expand them in terms of the small-$x$ dipole amplitude. This allows us to write the TEEC off the transversely polarized proton in terms of a C-odd interaction, corresponding to an odderon exchange. Due to the charge-conjugation-odd nature of the small-$x$ quark Sivers function, we restrict the sum over final hadronic states to positively and negatively charged hadrons separately. We present numerical predictions for the TEEC Sivers asymmetry at the EIC and find the magnitude of the asymmetry to be on the $0.1 \\%$ level. This channel offers a promising avenue for benchmarking the still largely unconstrained odderon amplitude."

They are universal and process-independent. As a matter of fact, nucleon PDFs are inevitably affected by nuclear matter during nuclear scattering process. In order to study the nuclear PDFs (nPDFs), in this paper, we introduce the nucleon pair PDFs (dPDFs) to describe parton distributions in the nucleon pair which is confined to a nucleus. We first of all construct the nuclear state in terms of the nucleonic states and calculate the operator definition of nPDFs. Neglecting the higher order corrections or multi-nucleon correlations, we find that nPDFs can be written as a sum of two terms which respectively correspond to PDFs and dPDFs. Nucleon pair PDFs which stem from nucleon-nucleon correlation are proportional to common nucleon PDFs but suppressed by a factor. Compared with the experimental data, we find that dPDFs can explain the behaviour of the EMC effect. We further calculate the Paschos-Wolfenstein ratio to study the nuclear matter effect on the extraction of weak mixing angle or $\\sin^2\\theta_W$ by using dPDFs."

By comparing the standard theory of electron-nucleus scattering with the equivalent photon method applied to Ultraperipheral Collisions (UPC) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. In the limit of extremely high beam energies and small energy transfers, very transparent equations emerge. We apply these equations to analyze nuclear fragmentation in UPCs at the LHC and $eA$ scattering at the EIC, demonstrating that the EIC could facilitate unique photonuclear physics studies. However, we have also shown that the fragmentation cross-sections at the EIC are about 1,000 times smaller than those at the LHC. At the LHC, the fragmentation of uranium nuclei displays characteristic double-hump mass distributions from fission events, while at the EIC, fragmentation is dominated by neutron emission and fewer few fission products, about 10,000 smaller number of events."

The spectroscopic quantities are obtained as the eigenvalues of the Dirac equation, where the nuclear densities computed via nuclear Density Functional Theory and the effect of the anomalous magnetic moment are incorporated. The results indicate that the isovector term's contribution to the optical potential is crucial for explaining the systematical differences in the strong shifts between $^{40}$Ca and $^{48}$Ca. Furthermore, it is found that both the strong shifts and the level widths exhibit significant dependence on the nuclear density profiles. These findings provide critical insights into the nuclear structures, particularly in the context of Calcium isotopes, by offering a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying nuclear-hadron properties."

The effective chiral Lagrangian for kaon-baryon and kaon-kaon interactions is utilized within chiral symmetry approach in combination with the interaction model between baryons. For the baryon-baryon interactions, we adopt the minimal relativistic mean-field theory with exchange of scalar mesons and vector mesons between baryons without including the nonlinear self-interacting meson field terms. In addition, the universal three-baryon repulsion and the phenomenological three-nucleon attraction are introduced as density-dependent effective two-body potentials. The repulsive effects leading to stiff equation of state at high densities consist of both the two-baryon repulsion via the vector-meson exchange and the universal three-baryon repulsion. Interplay of kaon condensates with hyperons through chiral dynamics in dense matter is clarified, and resulting onset mechanisms of kaon condensation in hyperon-mixed matter and the equation of state with the ($Y$+$K$) phase and characteristic features of the system are presented. It is shown that the slope $L$ of the symmetry energy controls the two-baryon repulsion beyond the saturation density and resulting stiffness of the equation of state. The stiffness of the equation of state in turn controls admixture of hyperons and the onset and development of kaon condensates as a result of competing effect between kaon condensates and hyperons. The equation of state with the ($Y$+$K$) phase becomes stiff enough to be consistent with recent observations of massive neutron stars. Static properties of neutron stars with the ($Y$+$K$) phase are discussed."

The nuclear matter phase is described within a relativistic density functional model of the DD2 class and the phase transition is obtained by a Maxwell construction. We find the region in the two-dimensional parameter space spanned by the vector meson coupling and the scalar diquark coupling, where three conditions are fulfilled: (1) the Maxwell construction can be performed, \\mbox{(2) the maximum} mass of the hybrid neutron star is not smaller than \\mbox{2.0 M$_\\odot$} and (3) the onset density of the phase transition is not below the nuclear saturation density $n_0=0.15$ fm$^{-3}$. The result of this study shows that the favorable neutron star equation of state has low onset masses for the occurrence of a color superconducting quark matter core between 0.5-0.7 $M_\\odot$ and maximum masses in the range 2.15-2.22 $M_\\odot$. In the typical mass range of 1.2-2.0 $M_\\odot$, the radii of these stars are between 11.9 and 12.4 km, almost independent of the mass. In principle, hybrid stars would allow for larger maximum masses than provided by the hadronic reference equation of state."

In this paper, the concept ``SU(3) analysis'' for B(E2) anomaly is proposed, and some new conclusions are obtained. The SU(3) third-order interaction $[L\\times Q \\times L]^{(0)}$ and level-crossing are both vital for the emergence of the B(E2) anomaly.

In principle, a specified $\\mathcal{E}\\mbox{-}P$ relation gives a unique $M\\mbox{-}R$ relation, and vice-versa. Our method is developed from the strong correlations that are shown to exist between the neutron star mass-radius curve and the equation of state (EOS) or pressure-energy density relation. Selecting points that have masses equal to fixed fractions of the maximum mass, we find a semi-universal power-law relation between the central energy densities, pressures, sound speeds, chemical potentials and number densities of those stars, with the maximum mass and the radii of one or more fractional maximum mass points. Root-mean-square fitting accuracies, for EOSs without large first-order phase transitions, are typically 0.5% for all quantities at all mass points. The method also works well, although less accurately, in reconstructing the EOS of hybrid stars with first-order phase transitions. These results permit, in effect, an analytic method of inverting an arbitrary mass-radius curve to yield its underlying EOS. We discuss applications of this inversion technique to the inference of the dense matter EOS from measurements of neutron star masses and radii as a possible alternative to traditional Bayesian approaches."
