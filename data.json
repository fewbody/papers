Following the recent implementation of the two-particle attached approach [Phys. Rev.C 110 (2024) 4, 044306], we focus on the two-particle-removed method. Using the equations-of-motion framework, we address both nuclear structure and dipole response functions by coupling coupled-cluster theory with the Lorentz integral transform technique. We perform calculations using chiral interactions, including three-nucleon forces, and estimate many-body uncertainties by comparing different coupled-cluster truncation schemes. We validate our approach by studying ground-state energies, excited states, and electric dipole polarizabilities in the oxygen and calcium isotopic chains. For binding energies and selected low-lying excited states, we achieve an accuracy comparable to that of the established closed-shell coupled-cluster theory and generally agree with experiment. Finally, we underestimate experimental data for electric dipole polarizabilities, particularly in calcium isotopes."

The wave functions of the low-lying states are constructed as superpositions of configurations with different intrinsic shapes and $K$ quantum numbers, projected onto good particle numbers and angular momenta. The MR-CDFT successfully reproduces the main features of the low-energy structure in $^{43}$S. Our results indicate that the ground state, $3/2^-_1$, is predominantly composed of the intruder prolate one-quasiparticle (1qp) configuration $\\nu1/2^-[321]$. In contrast, the $7/2^-_1$ state is identified as a high-$K$ isomer, primarily built on the prolate 1qp configuration $\\nu7/2^-[303]$. Additionally, the $3/2^-_2$ state is found to be an admixture dominated by an oblate configuration with $K^\\pi = 1/2^-$, along with a small contribution from a prolate configuration with $K^\\pi = 3/2^-$. These results demonstrate the capability of MR-CDFT to capture the intricate interplay among shape coexistence, $K$-mixing, and isomerism in the low-energy structure of odd-mass nuclei around $N = 28$."

Focusing on a system of two widely separated hydrogen atoms, one in an excited $nS$ state and the other in the ground $1S$ state, we isolate the electromagnetic contribution to the electron's total linear momentum by comparing the full energy-momentum tensor with the predictions of a point-like bound state model. Our analysis reveals that the leading perturbative correction introduces a factor $4/3$, which, along with subsequent corrections, indicates that the effective electromagnetic mass deviates from the conventional relation $E/c^2$. This discrepancy is attributed to the intrinsic nonlocality of the electromagnetic field, rather than to additional compensating mechanisms such as Poincar\\'e stresses. We further contrast our quantum field theory results with the highly accurate predictions of the Schr\\\"odinger equation, which, despite neglecting higher-order terms, achieves an average error on the order of $10^{-5}\\%$. Attempts to improve this accuracy via perturbative inclusion of the self-interaction of the electron's wave function instead increase the error, prompting a re-examination of the underlying perturbative assumptions. Our findings suggest that a non-perturbative treatment of the tree-level action may be required to fully capture the dynamics of bound states in quantum field theory."

Off-shell holography is a formalism most suitable for derivation of boundary effective actions. In this manuscript, we revisit the original Sakai-Sugimoto model using the off-shell formalism. Thus derived effective action is very rich in physics: it contains an $U(N_f)$ multiplet of massless pseudoscalars interacting (via trilinear and higher terms) with towers of massive (axial-) vector mesons. In contrast to the previous studies, our effective action is non-local. The original Chiral Lagrangian is recovered as its local expansion in small $\\pi$-meson momenta (derivative expansion). We particularly zoom in on the values of four derivative terms couplings, the low energy constants, and compare those with the ones reported in the literature."

The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared.

We explore how complexity correlates not only with macroscopic observables such as mass and radius, but also with the microscopic characteristics of the underlying equation of state. By incorporating both realistic equations of state and analytical solutions to Einstein's field equations, we demonstrate that gravitational mass plays a dominant role in determining the behavior of complexity. Furthermore, we show that strong phase transitions within the stellar interior, such as those hypothesized in hybrid stars, can manifest as distinct features in the complexity profile, offering a potential informational signature of such transitions. This work offers new insights into the link between information theory and compact object physics, highlighting complexity's potential as a diagnostic tool in astrophysics."

      "summary": "arXiv:2504.11102v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The reactor antineutrino anomaly, discovered in 2011, means a noticeable difference between the observed rate of inverse beta decays and the expected (theoretical) rate of such processes based on the measurement of the spectra of electrons in beta decay of $^{235}$U, $^{239}$Pu, $^{241}$Pu, and $^{238}$U nuclei and their subsequent conversion into right-handed antineutrino spectra. This paper provides a rationale for the fact that both right-handed and left-handed antineutrinos are produced in beta decays of nuclei. But the conversion procedure in any case assigns a right-handed antineutrino to each electron, which leads to the superiority of the theoretical rate of inverse beta decays over the experimental one. The right-handed antineutrino is produced in the mode of beta decay of the nucleus due to the standard electroweak interaction. The left-handed antineutrino appears in the mode caused by the existence of a interaction, the carrier of which is a massless pseudoscalar boson having a Yukawa coupling with the electron neutrino and nucleons. The emission of such a boson from a virtual right-handed antineutrino converts it into a free left-handed antineutrino."

We find that FFC can be significantly affected as the spatial variation rate of $\\lambda$ increases, and strong spatial variations can completely stabilize initially unstable systems. Using stability analysis based solely on initial conditions, we identified for the first time a critical variation rate above which no FFC occurs even if the flavor instability exists. By analyzing several representative matter profiles based on an 18 $M_{\\odot}$ SN model, we show that spatially inhomogeneous $\\lambda$ can suppress the occurrence of FFC associated with shallow ELN zero crossings in most of the SN's radial region, especially during the accretion phase. Our finding highlights the need to consider the impact of matter inhomogeneity in the development of improved SN models that aim to include the effect of neutrino flavor conversions."

These processes are studied for energies of the incident beams in the range 18-30 MeV, in order to have a sufficient energy to produce such a boson, whose mass is estimated to be around 17 MeV. We first analyze them as a purely electromagnetic processes, in the context of a state-of-the-art approach to nuclear strong-interaction dynamics and nuclear electromagnetic currents, derived from chiral effective field theory chiEFT. Next, we examine how the exchange of a hypothetical low-mass boson would impact the cross sections for such processes. We consider several possibilities, that this boson is either a scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, or axial particle. The main aim of the study is to exploit the specular structure of the 3He and 3H nuclei to investigate the isospin dependency of the X17-nucleon interaction, as the alleged \"proto-phobicity\"."

A major source of uncertainty comes from the detailed modeling of the initial state. While the collision itself likely involves far-from-equilibrium dynamics, it is not excluded that a fluid theory of second order can reasonably well describe its soft features. Here we explore this possibility and discuss how the state before the collision can be described in that setup, what are the requirements from relativistic causality to the form of the equations of motion, how much entropy production can result from shear and bulk viscous dissipation during the initial longitudinal dynamics, and how one can thus obtain sensible initial conditions for the subsequent transverse expansion. While we do here only first steps, we outline a larger program. If the latter could be successfully completed it could lead to a dynamical description of heavy-ion collisions where the only uncertainty lies in the thermodynamic and transport properties of quantum chromodynamics."

To constrain the EOS across its entire density range, this information needs to be combined consistently. However, the impact and model-dependency of individual observations vary. We present a broad compendium of different constraints and apply them individually to a large set of EOS candidates within a Bayesian framework. Specifically, we explore different ways how chiral effective field theory and perturbative quantum chromodynamics can be used to place a likelihood on EOS candidates. We also investigate the impact of nuclear experimental constraints, as well as different radio and X-ray observations of neutron star (NS) masses and radii. This is augmented by reanalyses of the existing data from BNS coalescences, in particular of GW170817, with improved models for the tidal waveform and kilonova light curves, which we also utilize to construct a tight upper limit of 2.39$\\,$M$_\\odot$ on the TOV mass based on GW170817's remnant. Our diverse set of constraints is eventually combined to obtain stringent limits on NS properties. We organize the combination in a way to distinguish between constraints where the systematic uncertainties are deemed small and those that rely on less conservative assumptions.
