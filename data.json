In this work we develop a unified theoretical framework for the calculation of inclusive (p,2p) and sequential (p,3p) reaction cross sections and fragment momentum distributions at intermediate and relativistic energies. The approach is based on a probabilistic extension of Glauber multiple-scattering theory combined with microscopic nuclear densities obtained from Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations using Skyrme energy-density functionals. We focus in particular on the sensitivity of total cross sections and longitudinal momentum dispersions to neutron-skin thickness along isotopic chains. Our results indicate that both (p,2p) and (p,3p) reactions exhibit a systematic decrease of cross section and momentum width with increasing neutron excess, reflecting enhanced attenuation and surface bias induced by neutron skins. The effect is significantly stronger for two-proton removal, suggesting that (p,3p) reactions may offer enhanced sensitivity to isovector nuclear structure. These findings establish proton-induced knockout reactions as complementary hadronic probes of neutron skins and the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy."

We present here microscopic calculations of rapidly rotating fission of the compound nucleus 240Pu under varying initial conditions within the time-dependent density functional theory framework. The obtained spin ratio of light to heavy nascent fragments is unchanged up to high spins but diminished as excitation energies increase, indicating sawtooth structures in fragment spins would fade away at high excitations rather than high angular momentum. Further analysis elucidates that the bending scission mode is predominated at low excitation energies, which has been under intense debates. Results also show thicker and elongated neck configurations, along with scission nucleons emitted perpendicular to the fission axis, owing to rapid rotations. These findings offer insights into the scission mechanism of rotating compound nuclei that have usually been overlooked in earlier studies."

We investigate the $4n$ system using nuclear lattice effective field theory in finite volumes with a lattice size up to $L=30$~fm, employing both a high-precision N$^3$LO interaction and a simplified SU(4) symmetric one. The ground-state energy is found to decrease smoothly with increasing box size, showing no plateau characteristic of a resonance. We further compute the dineutron-dineutron scattering phase shift using L\\\"uscher's finite-volume method. The phase shift is negative at low momenta, indicating repulsion in the dilute limit. At intermediate momenta, it exhibits a weak attraction with a peak of approximately $10^\\circ$ at relative momentum of 60-84~MeV. While this structure does not constitute a resonance, the corresponding confined $4n$ energy of 1.7-3.3~MeV lies close to the experimentally observed low-energy peak."

In view of the upcoming next generation of ground-based detectors, it is crucial to keep improving theoretical predictions to harvest the full scientific returns from these investments. We introduce here a substantial update of our Lagrangian numerical relativity code SPHINCS_BSSN. Apart from changing our unit system, we add constraint damping terms to the BSSN spacetime evolution equations. We demonstrate that this measure reduces, without noteworthy computational cost, the Hamiltonian constraint violations by more than an order of magnitude. We further implement contributions to thermal energy and pressure that are based on Fermi liquid theory and contain a parametrization of the Dirac effective mass. These terms can be combined with any cold equation of state, and they enhance the physical realism of our simulations and introduce a physics-based concept of a temperature. In a set of merger simulations, we demonstrate good agreement with other temperature-dependent numerical relativity simulations. We find that different parametrizations of the Dirac effective mass can translate into shifts of $\\sim 150$ Hz in the dominant post-merger gravitational wave peak frequency."

To this end, we explicitly find the shear and bulk viscosities -- the entanglement viscosities -- for thermal radiation in Rindler space using the universal spectral representation. A direct consequence of the obtained general formulas is the relationship between the acceleration-induced shear viscosity in flat space and the conformal quantum anomaly in curved space, pointing to a possible novel probe of the conformal anomaly in systems with extreme acceleration. Moreover, for conformal field theories, we explicitly show that globally entanglement viscosity saturates the Kovtun-Son-Starinets bound."

We approach the problem in terms of a minimax variational calculation based on the exact Gordon solution of the Dirac equation for the hydrogen atom ground state. The full Dirac treatment leads to the result that in an assumed variational state of size $R$, when $R$ minimizes the total energy the magnetic moment of the electron assumes its usual value, $e\\hbar/2mc$, but when $R<\\hbar/mc$, the effective electron magnetic moment becomes essentially $eR/2$, softening the hyperfine interaction and eliminating an energy minumum at small $R$. The magnetic moment of the proton is similarly suppressed, and the hyperfine interaction of a small size atom becomes bounded by the kinetic energy, thus assuring stability. We extend the Dirac variational calculation to positronium where we find simple results for the ground state energy and hyperfiine interaction, and then extend this variational calculation to Coulombic atoms of two fermions of arbitrary masses. This paper also lays out a framework for treating diquarks as relativistic Coulombic systems, in the presence of color electric and magnetic interactions."

Motivated by recent CMS data for $B_c^+$ production in Pb-Pb($5.02\\,$TeV) collisions at the LHC, we deploy a previously developed transport approach for charmonia and bottomonia to evaluate the kinetics of $B_c$ mesons throughout the fireball formed in these reactions. The main inputs to our approach are two transport parameters: the $B_c$'s reaction rate and equilibrium limit. Both quantities are determined by previous calculations via a combination of charm and bottom sectors. In-medium binding energies of $B_c$ mesons are calculated from a thermodynamic $T$-matrix with a lattice-QCD constrained potential, and figure in their inelastic reaction rates. Temperature-dependent equilibrium limits include charm- and bottom-quark fugacities based on their initial production. We compute the centrality dependence of inclusive $B_c$ production and transverse-momentum ($p_T$) spectra using two different recombination models, instantaneous coalescence and resonance recombination. The main uncertainty in the resulting nuclear modification factors, $R_{\\rm AA}$, is currently associated with the $B_c$ cross section in elementary $pp$ collisions, caused by the uncertainty in the branching ratio for the $B_c^-\\to J/\\psi\\mu^-\\bar \\nu$ decay. Our results indicate a large enhancement of the $R_{\\rm AA}$ at low $p_T$, with significant regeneration contributions up to $p_T\\simeq\\,20\\,$GeV. Comparisons to CMS data are carried out but firm conclusions will require a more accurate value of the branching ratio, or alternative channels to measure the $B_c$ production in $pp$ collisions."
