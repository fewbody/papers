While broadly applicable to various quantum systems, in…[Phys. Rev. Lett. 136, 032501] Published Fri Jan 23, 2026"

(STAR Collaboration)High-energy, heavy-ion collisions can create local domains of chirality-imbalanced quarks, reflecting the topological features of quantum chromodynamics. The chiral magnetic effect (CME) predicts an electric charge separation of quarks in such topological domains along the magnetic field ($\\stackrel…[Phys. Rev.
