Collective chiral and wobbling modes are identified for $\\gamma>15^\\circ$ via spin coherent state (SCS) maps and spin squeezed state (SSS) plots. Their entanglement increases from moderate values at the band head to near-maximal values at $I=20$. The area $\\mathcal{F}$ of the chiral partners changes order as function of $I$ which reflects the crossing of the partner bands as a signature of chirality. For the $\\pi(1h_{11/2})^2$ configuration, the antisymmetrization required by the Pauli exclusion principle causes strong entanglement between the two protons, which significantly amplifies the area $\\mathcal{F}$. For $\\gamma<15^\\circ$, the lowest bands become various uniformly rotating quasiparticle configurations, which have large values of $\\mathcal{F}$ for all values $I$."

      "summary": "arXiv:2504.05797v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The pygmy dipole resonance (PDR) at the low-lying tail of the giant dipole resonance (GDR) is an interesting research subject as it carries important information about the nuclear surface with mixed isoscalar and isovector vibrations in $N > Z$ systems. The present paper investigates the possible existence of the PDR built on excited states in a neutron-rich $^{80}$Ge nucleus using the phonon damping model (PDM) with and without pairing correlation at zero and finite temperatures. The results obtained within the PDM with exact pairing (EP+PDM) reveal the appearance of two enhanced $\\gamma$-transitions $E_\\gamma = 7.25$ and 7.35 MeV at $T=0.6$ MeV, which carry the PDR nature and hence implying the possible existence of PDR built on excited states in this nucleus. These two $\\gamma$-energies nicely match with a recent experimental observation, thus indicating the crucial role of the inclusion of exact pairing solution in the precise description of low-lying $\\gamma$-transitions. The partition function-based analysis shows that this predicted PDR at $T=$ 0.6MeV is mainly contributed by the first $2^+$ excited state of the $^{80}$Ge nucleus. The isospin mixing at the nuclear surface is also observed in the investigated PDR at $T=0.6-0.7$ MeV. The primary mechanism underlying the emergence of the hot PDR is found due to the coupling of GDR phonon to non-collective particle-particle and hole-hole configurations at finite temperatures within the PDM framework, along with the shift in particle-hole excitation energies due to thermal pairing correlations"

Motivated by the differential cross-section data for $\\gamma p \\to K^+ \\Sigma^0$ from CLAS 2010, which exhibits some bump structures at $W \\approx$ 1875, 2080 and 2270 MeV, we extend our previous analysis by investigating the effects of $N(1535)1/2^-$, $N(1875)3/2^-$, $N(2080)1/2^- \\&\\ 3/2^-$ and $N(2270)1/2^- , 3/2^- \\&\\ 5/2^-$, as strange partners of $P_c$ molecular states, in the reactions $\\gamma p \\to K^+ \\Sigma^0$ and $\\gamma p \\to K^0 \\Sigma^+$.

It contains the contributions from $s$-channel with exchanges of $N$, $\\Delta$, $N^*$ (including the hadronic molecules with hidden strangeness), and $\\Delta^*$; $t$-channel; $u$-channel; and the generalized contact term. The results corresponding to the final fitted parameters are in good agreement with all available experimental data of both cross-sections and polarization observables for $\\gamma p \\to K^+ \\Sigma^0$ and $\\gamma p \\to K^0 \\Sigma^+$. Notably, the $s$-channel exchanges of molecules significantly contribute to the bump structures in cross-sections for $\\gamma p \\to K \\Sigma$ at $W \\approx$ 1900, 2080 and 2270 MeV, and show considerable coherence with contributions from $s$-channel exchanges of general resonances to construct the overall structures of cross-sections.

In this paper, we develop, implement, and test two model-driven emulators based on (Petrov-)Galerkin projection using the prototypical test case of two-body scattering with the Minnesota potential and a more realistic local chiral potential. The high-fidelity scattering equations are solved with the matrix Numerov method, a reformulation of the popular Numerov recurrence relation for solving special second-order differential equations as a linear system of coupled equations. A novel error estimator based on reduced-space residuals is applied to an active learning approach (a greedy algorithm) to choosing training samples (\"snapshots\") for the emulator and contrasted with a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) approach. Both approaches allow for computationally efficient offline-online decompositions, but the greedy approach requires much fewer snapshot calculations. These developments set the groundwork for emulating scattering observables based on chiral nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions and optical models, where computational speed-ups are necessary for Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Our emulators and error estimators are widely applicable to linear systems."

This EoS is applied to derive opacities and calculate the yields of isotopes formed in r-process and s-process nucleosynthesis, with and without the influence of neutrino masses or oscillations. We look at both the lanthanide and actinide sequences using the MvdW parameters that involve the interaction strength and excluded volume effects. Our results reflect the characteristic differences found in r and s processes in the synthesis and long-term evolution of isotopes from the U, Th, and Sr chain across galactic environments. The inclusion of neutrino masses enhances the neutron-to-proton ratio, favoring heavier r-process isotopes and altering the overall galactic yields by cross section suppression. These findings offer insights into the interplay of nuclear physics and astrophysical environments, highlighting the sensitivity of nucleosynthetic pathways to EoS modifications and neutrino physics. We compare these results to metallicity profiles of similar models: the Galactic Leaky Box, the Galactic Inflow, and the Galactic Closed Box models and to the kilonova event GW170781."

The lessons learned from studying the proton are also vital with respect to the modern challenge of the nature of baryon excited states."

Using relativistic perturbation theory with an equation-of-state family informed by chiral effective field theory, we show that such a resonance may be detectable with next-generation interferometers and possibly already with LIGO A+ for sufficiently loud events."

The quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, combined with the in-medium similarity renormalization group (IMSRG), is employed to compute their low-lying states. This approach reasonably reproduces the coexistence of weakly and strongly deformed states at comparable energies, and allows us to track the emergence of the $N=20$ island of inversion through the continuous IMSRG evolution of the chiral Hamiltonian. Our results indicate that the ground state of $^{33}$Mg with spin-parity $3/2^-$ is predominantly a strongly deformed configuration with $K^\\pi = 3/2^-$, while the lowest $7/2^-$ state is predicted to be a shape isomer, consisting of a mixture of weakly deformed configurations with different $K$ values.

In this paper, we present a primary study of bulk and shear viscosities in the limit $T/\\mu_B \\ll 1$, where $T$ and $\\mu_B$ are the temperature and the baryon chemical potential. The analysis is performed for a generic system where nucleons are dressed by the condensation of both scalar and vector interactions. Under the relaxation time approximation of the Boltzmann equation, we compute the viscosities of the system to leading power in $T/\\mu_B$ expansion and establish a relation between the thermodynamic potential and transport coefficients, including bulk viscosity ($\\zeta$) and shear viscosity ($\\eta$). It is found that hydrodynamic stability ($\\zeta>0$) imposes additional constraints on the thermodynamic potential. As an example, these relations are applied to the Walecka model. The fluid properties of the cold and dense nucleon matter are characterized by the dimensionless combination of viscosities times the quasi-Fermi momentum over the enthalpy. Furthermore, we discuss the implication of the stability condition on the range of applicability of the model."

The interquark interaction in the model is reminiscent of that derived in Coulomb gauge QCD, with the string tension being the only model parameter. We demonstrate that while the confining interaction induces spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry at T=0, chiral symmetry gets restored at a temperature Tch ~ 90 MeV for the string tension fixed to provide the phenomenological value of the quark condensate. This temperature is similar to Tch ~ 130 MeV observed on the lattice in the chiral limit for N_c=3. The physical mechanism responsible for the chiral symmetry restoration in the confining regime is Pauli blocking of the quark levels, required for the existence of a nonvanishing quark condensate, by the thermal excitations of the quarks and antiquarks. Thus, above the chiral restoration temperature, the meson-like states are chirally symmetric and approximately chiral spin symmetric. A crucial property of the confined meson-like light-light states above Tch is their size that exceeds drastically that in the chirally broken phase below Tch, in contrast to the heavy-heavy mesons that nearly preserve their size irrespective of the temperature. This property is a result of Pauli blocking of the quark and antiquark levels with small momenta. Furthermore, the root-mean-square radius of the states with J=0,1 diverges in the chiral limit. This unexpected property must be a key to understanding unusual features of the hot QCD matter as observed at RHIC and LHC. Consequently, the confining but chirally symmetric matter above Tch can be considered as a dense system of very large and strongly overlapping meson-like states (``strings'')."

The hidden-charm states with $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $1^{++}$, and $2^{++}$ quantum numbers are then searched for. For $0^{++}$, the analysis reveals three poles in the $D\\bar{D}$-$D_s\\bar{D}_s$ coupled-channel amplitude, corresponding to three states. Two of these poles, located near the $D\\bar{D}$ and $D_s\\bar{D}_s$ thresholds, can be interpreted as mostly molecular states.

The number of poles found in the $D\\bar D$-$D_s \\bar D_s$ system is the same as that found in the original lattice analysis though the position of the third pole changes sizeably. In the $1^{++}$ sector, we find two poles in the complex energy plane.

In the $2^{++}$ sector, we also report two poles and find that the dressed $\\chi_{c2}(2P)$ is lighter than the $D^*\\bar{D}^*$ molecular state, with the dynamics of the latter closely related to that of the heavy-quark spin-symmetry partner of the $X(3872)$. Our exploratory study of the $1^{++}$ and $2^{++}$ sectors offers valuable insights into their dynamics, but given that the fits that we carry out are underconstrained, more lattice data are required to draw robust conclusions."

The critical mass for the appearance of quark matter decreases with increasing dark matter content. We introduce the concept of \"masquerading hybrid stars\", where dark matter admixed stars exhibit similar mass-radius relations to purely hadronic stars, making it challenging to distinguish between them based solely on these parameters.
