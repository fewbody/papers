      "summary": "arXiv:2506.05564v2 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The Landau-Migdal parameter $G'_0$ characterizes the main part of the spin-isospin nucleon-nucleon interaction. Consequently, the $G'_0$ is closely related to the Gamow-Teller resonance (GTR), the beta and double-beta decay rates of finite nuclei, the spin response of hot and dense nucleonic matter that determines the neutrino-nucleon reaction rates in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, and finally the critical density for pion condensation in neutron stars. Historically, the $G'_0$ was obtained by fitting the peak location of experimental GTR spectra by using phenomenological pion exchange models, without strict uncertainty quantification. In this letter, for the first time, we report the Bayesian inference of $G'_0$ by using a self-consistent Skyrme Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation (QRPA) model and joint constraints from experimental GTR measurements on $^{208}\\mathrm{Pb}$, $^{132}\\mathrm{Sn}$, $^{90}\\mathrm{Zr}$. Our extracted $G_0'$ is $0.48\\pm0.034$, which is close to the prediction of a few existing Skyrme models that consider the spin-isospin observables but is smaller than the extracted ones from pion-exchange models. We hint to possible reasons for this deviation, like the value of the nucleon effective mass $\\frac{m^*}{m}$. Finally, we demonstrate the influence of $G'_0$ on neutrino opacities in CCSNe and BNS mergers. The new Skyrme parameterizations from our Bayesian study may also be used to study other spin-isospin-dependent phenomena."

However, standard phenomenological EoS models often rely on heuristic extrapolations in the low-density regime, which are inconsistent with microscopic predictions. In this work, we refine a unified meta-modeling framework for the EoS by incorporating low-density corrections based on energy density functionals constrained by ab initio neutron-matter calculations. Using Bayesian inference to combine information from astrophysical observations, nuclear theory, and experiments, we assess the impact of these corrections on key crustal properties, including the crust-core transition density and pressure, crustal composition, and moment of inertia. The improved model reduces uncertainties in the inner crust and emphasizes the importance of low-density physics in EoS modeling, highlighting the value of integrating both theoretical and observational constraints across densities to robustly describe the EoS. Moreover, the adopted approach can be readily applied to any existing EoS model to provide a solid framework for interpreting upcoming high-precision multimessenger data."

      "summary": "arXiv:2506.05849v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: One of the most vital topics of today's high-energy nuclear physics is the investigation of the nuclear structure of the collided nuclei. Recent studies at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have shown that several observables, such as the collective flow and transverse-momentum correlations of the produced particles, can be sensitive to various nuclear structure and deformation parameters. Femtoscopy, another essential tool for investigating the space-time geometry of the matter created in nuclear collisions, has not yet been widely applied to such studies. Using a multiphase transport model (AMPT), in this Letter, it is demonstrated that the femtoscopic source parameters of pion pairs can also serve as a robust signal of unique nuclear structure. Through an analysis of $^{208}$Pb+$^{20}$Ne and $^{208}$Pb+$^{16}$O collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}$ = 68.5 GeV, two collision systems especially relevant to the SMOG2 program of the LHCb experiment, it is shown that a deformed initial shape can significantly affect femtoscopic source parameters. This study highlights the importance of expanding the nuclear structure investigations to femtoscopic observables and serves as a baseline for numerous possible future studies in this new direction."

This study explores how accurately equations of state with strong first-order phase transitions can be represented using spectral or piecewise analytic methods that assume no {\\it{a priori}} knowledge of the location or the strength of the phase transition. The model equations of state used in this study have phase transitions strong enough to induce a gravitational instability that terminates the sequence of stable neutron stars. These equations of state also admit a second sequence of stable stars with core matter that has undergone this strong first-order phase transition (possibly driven by quark deconfinement). These results indicate that spectral representations generally achieve somewhat higher accuracy than piecewise analytic representations having the same number of parameters. Both types of representation show power-law convergence at approximately the same rate."

      "summary": "arXiv:2506.05499v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Once regarded as mere emptiness, the vacuum is now understood to possess a rich and complex structure, characterized by fluctuating energy fields and a condensate of virtual quark-antiquark pairs. These pairs cause spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, a fundamental phenomenon that is believed to generate over 99% of the mass in the visible universe. However, the precise mechanism linking the chiral symmetry breaking to the mass generation associated with quark confinement remains one of the most profound open questions in physics. Here, we investigate high energy proton-proton collisions at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where those collisions could liberate virtual quark-antiquark pairs from the vacuum. These virtual pairs, particularly the strange quark-antiquark pairs, are initially quantum spin-entangled and later undergo quark confinement to form hadrons such as $\\Lambda$ hyperons. In this Letter, we report the first evidence of spin correlation of $\\Lambda\\bar{\\Lambda}$ hyperon pairs measured by the STAR experiment at RHIC - a relative polarization signal of $(18 \\pm 4)\\%$ that links the spin-entangled quark pairs of the Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) vacuum to their final-state hadron counterparts. Crucially, this correlation vanishes when the hyperon pairs are widely separated in angle, consistent with the decoherence of the quantum system. Our findings provide a new experimental paradigm for exploring the dynamics and interplay of quark confinement and entanglement."

Excitation energies and spin-parities were determined for several states, including two unobserved resonances at $E_r$ $=$ $18.7$~keV and $E_r$ $=$ $50.5$~keV. The angular correlation analysis enabled the first unambiguous determination of the orbital angular momentum transfer for these states. These results provide a significant update to the $^{30}$Si(p,$\\gamma$)$^{31}$P thermonuclear reaction rate, with direct implications for models of nucleosynthesis in globular clusters and other astrophysical sites. The revised rate is substantially lower than previous estimates at temperatures below $200$~MK, affecting predictions for silicon isotopic abundances in stellar environments. Our work demonstrates the power of NRF in constraining nuclear properties, and provides a framework for future studies of low-energy resonances relevant to astrophysical reaction rates."

Electrons, neutrinos, and up and down quarks are distributed across two lattice sites and mapped to 32 qubits, with an additional 4 qubits used for flag-based error mitigation. A four-fermion interaction is used to implement weak interactions, and lepton-number violation is induced by a neutrino Majorana mass. Quantum circuits that prepare the initial nucleus and time evolve with the Hamiltonian containing the strong and weak interactions are executed on IonQ Forte Enterprise. A clear signal of neutrinoless double-$\\beta$ decay is measured, making this the first quantum simulation to observe lepton-number violation in real time. This was made possible by co-designing the simulation to maximally utilize the all-to-all connectivity and native gate-set available on IonQ's quantum computers. Quantum circuit compilation techniques and co-designed error-mitigation methods, informed from executing benchmarking circuits with up to 2,356 two-qubit gates, enabled observables to be extracted with high precision.

For various numbers of fermion flavors, the single-site shift symmetry of the staggered-fermion action is broken in a finite region of the $(\\beta, m)$ phase space. Simulations are performed with six degenerate fermion flavors and a range of $\\beta$ values that span the phase boundary. Center vortices are demonstrated to capture the broken shift symmetry that manifests in the unphysical phase. This persists at the level of each individual plaquette orientation, where it is revealed only the plaquettes that span the broken dimension are affected. Several bulk center-vortex quantities, including the vortex and branching point densities, are considered to highlight other aspects of vortex geometry sensitive to the unphysical phase. A slight preference for the plaquettes affected by the broken shift symmetry to be pierced by a vortex is observed. This translates also to a greater branching point density in three-dimensional slices that span the broken dimension. Combined, these findings provide a novel characterization of the unphysical phase in terms of the fundamental center degrees of freedom."

We compute its real-time evolution while propagating through the Glasma classical background fields, which act as an interaction potential in the quantum evolution of the jet. We present results for the momentum broadening and jet quenching parameter of a jet at mid-rapidity, with special emphasis on the anisotropies between the longitudinal and transverse directions relative to the collision axis.

This direct process is scrutinized using a non-adiabatic Faddeev hyperspherical harmonics $R$-matrix expansion method, and the derived reaction rates are discussed. After reviewing the model, the resultant photo-disintegration of $^{12}$C($2^+_1\\rightarrow 0^+$) is shown to be much smaller than the values predicted by the adiabatic models for $0.15 \\le E \\le 0.35$ MeV. Despite the large difference, the derived reaction rates are illustrated to be concordant with the current evaluated rates for $0.08 \\le T_9 \\le 3$. The difference below $E=0.20$ MeV can be seen in the rates for $T_9 \\le 0.07$. In comparison with the calculations, the rates are found to be reduced by about 10$^{-4}$ at $T_9=0.05$, because of an accurate description for $^8$Be break-up. Uncertainties of the rates are also estimated by examining sensitivity to 3$\\alpha$ potentials. With introducing three-body $S$-factors and a resonant term, the present rates are expressed in an analytic form, and they are provided in a tabular form for astrophysical applications. To update the evaluated rates, non-resonant sequential process between $\\alpha+^8$Be could be deleted by hand. The astrophysical impact is not expected to be large, although the rates are reduced around $T_9=0.05$."

The analysis of energy conditions reveals deviations from standard GR, with PFDM affecting the weak and strong energy conditions. The study further examines the impact of NED and PFDM on the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), demonstrating that PFDM shifts the ISCO radius and that the combined effects of NED and PFDM field parameters sufficiently influence orbital stability. Our analysis of the black hole shadow reveals that PFDM increases the shadow radius, while a higher charge reduces it, leading to modifications in potential astrophysical observables. The thermodynamic behavior of the black hole exhibits phase transitions marked by changes in heat capacity, indicating possible stability regimes. Moreover, we derive equations for black hole shadow size and study the spacetime effects on the shadow. These results provide a framework for testing alternative gravity theories and understanding the role of exotic matter in strong gravitational fields. Finally, we compare the constraints on NED and PFDM field parameters derived from our black hole model with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87* and Sgr A*, providing observational limits on deviations from GR."
