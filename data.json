This report discusses the measurements in the context of predictions from hydrodynamics, emphasizing the enhanced sensitivity of factorial cumulants and their implications for the search for the QCD critical point.

I here construct a simple schematic model which simulates this phenomenon. The model consists of a random matrix Hamiltonian based on the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), which is coupled to an entrance channel Hamiltonian in the discrete basis representation. I show that the transmission coefficients are almost unity when both the level density and the decay widths of the GOE configurations are large, realizing the strong absorption regime. On the other hand, when these parameters are small, the transmission coefficients are significantly structured as a function of energy. In that situation, the transmission coefficients at resonance energies reach unity in this model, that is consistent with the experimental finding of the cross section deficit."

The results indicate that the Prox.77-3 T-DEP proximity potential model yields the best performance, with the lowest root mean square deviation ({\\sigma}=0.515), reflecting a high consistency with experimental data. In contrast, Bass77, AW95, Ngo80, and Guo2013 display larger deviations. The inclusion of temperature dependence significantly improves the accuracy of models such as Prox.77-3, Prox.77-6, and Prox.77-7. The -decay half-lives of 36 potential superheavy nuclei were further predicted using the five most accurate proximity potential models and Ni's empirical formula, with the results aligning well with experimental data. These predictions underscore the high reliability of the CPPM combined with proximity potential models in the theoretical calculation of {\\alpha}-decay half-lives of superheavy nuclei, offering valuable theoretical insights for future experimental investigations of superheavy nuclei."

While the model space was restricted only to seniority zero configurations in the previous applications of the NEGF method, we remove this restriction and include seniority non-zero configurations as well. In such model space, a proton-neutron interaction is active, for which we introduce a random interaction. We find that the seniority non-zero configurations significantly increase the fission cross sections, and thus the fission-to-capture branching ratios, even though they are still underestimated by about one order of magnitude as compared to the experimental data. In addition, we also find that the fission dynamics is governed by only a small number of eigenstates of the model Hamiltonian."

Many models, however, rely on energy functionals based on assumptions that have not been rigorously validated. We critically analyze a commonly used ansatz for confinement, where the energy functional scales with density as $U \\propto n^{\\frac{2}{3}}$ . Our findings, derived from a systematic non-local energy functional, reveal that this scaling does not capture the dynamics of confinement. Instead, the energy functional evolves from $n^2$ at low densities to $n$ at high densities, governed by an infrared cutoff. These results suggest that models relying on such assumptions should be revisited to ensure more reliable EoS construction."

In recent years, it has been argued that the NMEs of cMDMs can be related to the third moment of the nucleon's higher-twist (specifically, twist-three) parton distribution function (PDF) $e(x)$, which can, in principle, be measured through dihadron production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering processes. By applying the spin-flavor expansion to the cMDM operators in the large-$N_c$ limit, where $N_c$ is the number of quark colors, we show that the NMEs receive contributions not only from the twist-three PDF $e(x)$ but also from an additional, previously neglected nucleon form factor. Incorporating constraints from the spin-flavor expansion, recent experimental data on $e(x)$, as well as model calculations of $e(x)$, we estimate the NMEs of the cMDM operators. Our analysis indicates that the NMEs are dominated by the nucleon form factors, and the cMDM contributions to pion-nucleon couplings can be comparable to those from the quark sigma terms."

We numerically solve these equations and compute the transport coefficient $\\kappa$, which is anisotropic and initially very large. Further, we extract observables sensitive to the initial glasma stage. The heavy quark nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ is affected by the glasma but the effect is moderate compared to the nPDF contribution.

The improved quadrupole moments from this work will be immensely useful to estimate quadrupole shifts of the clock transitions of Yb$^+$.

Our computed transition form factors show reasonable agreement with experimental data at large photon virtualities. However, deviations emerge at low $Q^2$, where experimental results exhibit a sharper variation than theoretical predictions. This discrepancy is expected, as these continuum QCD analyses account only for the quark-core of baryons, while low photon virtualities are dominated by meson cloud effects. We anticipate that these analytical predictions, based on the simplified SCI framework, will serve as a valuable benchmark for more refined studies and QCD-based truncations that incorporate quark angular momentum and the contributions of scalar and vector diquarks."

In our work we focus on two stages, directly after the supernova shock wave moves outwards, where neutrinos are still captured in the core and the lepton per baryon ratio is fixed to $Y_L = 0.4$, and a few seconds afterwards, when all neutrinos have left the star. All nuclear equations of state used for this purpose fulfill the binding energy constraints from chiral effective field theory for neutron matter at zero temperature. We find for the neutrino-trapped case higher minimal masses than for the case when neutrinos have left the proto-neutron star. Thermal effects, here in the form of a given constant entropy per baryon $s$, have a smaller effect on increasing the minimal mass. The minimal proto-neutron star mass for the first evolutionary stage with $Y_L = 0.4$ and $s = 1$ amounts to $M_{min} \\sim 0.62M_{\\odot}$ and for the stage without neutrinos and $s = 2$ to $M_{min} \\sim 0.22M_{\\odot}$ rather independent on the nuclear equation of state used. We also study the case related to an accretion induced collapse of a white dwarf where the initial lepton fraction is $Y_L = 0.5$ and observe large discrepancies in the results of the different tables of nuclear equations of state used. Our finding points towards a thermodynamical inconsistent treatment of the nuclear liquid-gas phase transition for nuclear equations of state in tabular form demanding a fully generalized three-dimensional Gibbs construction for a proper treatment. Finally, we demonstrate that there is a universal relation for the increase of the proto-neutron star minimal mass with the lepton fraction for all nuclear equations of state used."

We refit three representative RMF parameter sets (DD-ME2, PKDD, NL3), considering the uncertainties in nuclear matter saturation properties. Utilizing the resulting star structure, composition and nucleon properties in the medium obtained in a consistent manner, we calculate the pinning energy of superfluid vortex in the nuclear lattice in the inner crust. This leads to the evolution of associated pinning force that acts on the vortex, which can be confronted with observed glitch amplitude and short-time relaxation in the 2000 Vela glitch event, following the snowplow model of pulsar glitch. We discuss how the vortex configuration and pinning properties depend on the nuclear parameters, and find an interesting and dominant role of the nuclear symmetry energy slope on pinning strength."

Compared to the traditionally used Walecka-type models in nuclear matter studies, our approach improves the behavior of symmetry energy and the incompressibility coefficient in describing empirical data without introducing additional freedoms. Moreover, the predicted neutron star structures fall within the constraints of GW170817, PSR J0740+6620, and PSR J0030+0451, while the maximum neutron star mass can reach about $~3M_{\\odot}$ with a pure hadronic phase.

      "summary": "arXiv:2501.05092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The spin-orbit correlation in spin-0 hadrons can be investigated through the kinetic energy-momentum tensor form factor $\\tilde F^q(t)$. We observe that the latter is also related to a torque about the radial direction, which we interpret as a chiral stress. If we neglect the quark mass contribution, then $\\tilde F^q(t)$ is simply proportional to the electromagnetic form factor for spin-0 hadrons, and the spin-orbit correlation is equal to minus half of the valence quark number. Given the extensive studies on the electromagnetic form factor for spin-0 hadrons such as pions, kaons, and the $\\alpha$ particle, we present the spatial distributions of chiral stress and kinetic spin-orbit correlation based on current parametrizations of the pion electromagnetic form factor."

      "summary": "arXiv:2502.03577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Astrophysical observations of the cosmos allow us to probe extreme physics and answer foundational questions on our universe. Modern astronomy is increasingly operating under a holistic approach, probing the same question with multiple diagnostics including how sources vary over time, how they appear across the electromagnetic spectrum, and through their other signatures, including gravitational waves, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and dust on Earth. Astrophysical observations are now reaching the point where approximate physics models are insufficient. Key sources of interest are explosive transients, whose understanding requires multidisciplinary studies at the intersection of astrophysics, gravity, nuclear science, plasma physics, fluid dynamics and turbulence, computation, particle physics, atomic, molecular, and optical science, condensed matter and materials science, radiation transport, and high energy density physics. This white paper provides an overview of the major scientific advances that lay at the intersection of physics and astronomy and are best probed through time-domain and multimessenger astrophysics, an exploration of how multidisciplinary science can be fostered, and introductory descriptions of the relevant scientific disciplines and key astrophysical sources of interest."
