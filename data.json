Our analysis is based on a hybrid equation of state with a phase transition from hadronic matter containing hyperons to color-superconducting quark matter, where the quark phase is modeled within a relativistic density functional approach. By varying the strength of the vector repulsion and diquark pairing couplings in the microscopic quark Lagrangian, we construct a set of hybrid star sequences with different quark-matter onset densities. This framework ensures consistency with astrophysical and gravitational wave constraints on mass, radius, and tidal deformability."

      "summary": "arXiv:2512.08097v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Physics based emulators offer a fast and reliable replacement for an exact solution of the scattering problem in nuclear physics. Previous work developed a reduced-basis emulator for single-channel elastic scattering using an optical potential. Since many reactions of interest can be cast as a coupled-channel problem, the purpose of this work is to extend the RBM to a coupled-channel framework (CC-RBM). Although the framework derived is general, in this work we apply it to reactions where the Hamiltonian coupling term comes from assuming a rotational structure model for the target. From a set of training coupled-channel wavefunctions, we perform a singular value decomposition to obtain a reduced set of basis wavefunctions, and then solve the extended (Petrov-)Galerkin equations. In addition, the empirical interpolation method is used to expand the potentials. We apply the CC-RBM method to elastic and inelastic scattering of neutrons on 48Ca including a quadrupole coupling to populate the first 2+ state, and neutrons on 208Pb, including an octupole coupling to populate its first 3- state. We demonstrate that the CC-RBM calculated cross sections match those obtained using traditional finite-difference methods. We show that the CC-RBM results can reliably reproduce the nuclear scattering cross sections at different energy regimes. The computational accuracy versus time plots demonstrate that the CC-RBM method efficiently increases precision with increasing basis size. Most importantly, for the precisions required in reaction calculations (a percent on the cross section), we find the CC-RBM method offers roughly one and a half orders of magnitude gain in computational speed compared to the traditional coupled-channels solver. However, we also discuss how this scaling becomes less favorable, the larger the number of channels included in the coupled-channel set."

Our approach employs Bayesian analysis to study this phenomenon. Hadronic matter is modeled using the relativistic mean-field (RMF) approximation, for which we have selected two parameter sets: \\(NL3^{*}\\omega\\rho\\), representing hadronic matter with nucleons only, and $EL3\\omega\\rho$ with nucleons only and $EL3\\omega\\rho Y$, which includes hyperons. On the other hand deconfined quark matter is modeled using the vector-MIT bag model. For our purpose, the phase transition is implemented using the Maxwell construction. Bayesian inference is performed by tuning three parameters: the bag constant (i.e. $B^{1/4}$), the vector coupling constant \\(\\left(G_{v}\\right)\\), and the Dirac sea contribution ($b_{4}$). We found that a phase transition could exist at densities below \\(2.0\\,n_{0}\\) for both the $EL3\\omega\\rho - EL3\\omega\\rho Y $ and $NL3^{*}\\omega\\rho$ parametrizations. As a consequence, our results also indicate that a hybrid neutron star could have a large quark core that comprises more than \\(80\\%\\) of its size."

As reactor antineutrino experiments now target sub-percent-level sensitivity to oscillation parameters, a precise theoretical description of IBD, including recoil, weak magnetism, nucleon structure, and radiative corrections, becomes essential. In this work, we give a detailed and precise calculation of the total and differential cross sections for radiative IBD, $\\overline{\\nu}_e p \\to e^+ n \\gamma$. We use a heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory framework, systematically incorporating electroweak, electromagnetic, and strong-interaction corrections. We derive new analytic cross-section expressions, clarify the collinear structure of radiative corrections, and provide a systematic uncertainty analysis. We also discuss phenomenological applications for reactor antineutrino experiments, e.g., JUNO, and neutron decay. Our results enable sub-permille theoretical precision, supporting current and future experiments."

The state-of-the-art framework, KoMPoST, employs non-equilibrium Green's functions to propagate the initial energy-momentum tensor to the hydrodynamic phase, yet currently only treats transverse plane dynamics under boost-invariant conditions. In this work, we extend KoMPoST to include non-boost-invariant responses to initial conditions, essential for accurately capturing the longitudinal structures observed in heavy-ion collisions. Non-boost-invariant fluctuations on top of a homogeneous background are evolved using (3+1)D response functions calculated in kinetic theory. To assess kinetic theory's transition towards hydrodynamic evolution, we systematically compare the out-of-equilibrium shear-stress tensor from KoMPoST-3D with estimates based on Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics. Subsequently, a comprehensive (3+1)D framework, McDIPPER+KoMPoST-3D+CLVisc+SMASH, is utilized to simulate the complete spacetime evolution of heavy-ion collisions. The sensitivity of key observables, including longitudinal structure of anisotropic flow, to variations in the hydrodynamic initialization time is thoroughly investigated."

In its initial phase, we start with the leading Fock sector $|qqq\\rangle$ and an effective light-front Hamiltonian incorporating confinement and one-gluon exchange within which BLFQ can already successfully describe key nucleon observables. The framework has since been extended to include the next-to-leading Fock sector $|qqqg\\rangle$, enabling studies of gluonic contributions to the nucleon's internal structure, including gluon helicity, orbital angular momentum, and three-dimensional imaging through generalized and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (GPDs and TMDs). Most recently, BLFQ has achieved a significant milestone by computing nucleon light-front wavefunctions as eigenstates of the QCD Hamiltonian without an explicit confining potential. These calculations, including Fock sectors up to $|qqqq\\bar{q}\\rangle$, further develop the path to first-principles predictions of quark and gluon matter densities, helicity and transversity distributions, and spin observables, showing qualitative agreement with experimental and phenomenological results. Together, these developments highlight BLFQ's growing capacity to provide an increasingly complete and realistic picture of nucleon structure grounded in QCD."

An example is an estimate of the $J/\\psi~p$ scattering length $|\\alpha_{J/\\psi~p}|$ on the bound proton obtained using the Vector Meson Dominance model. This value can be compared with that of the free proton from the GlueX Collaboration. One may then project what would be expected from the SRC/CT Collaboration Experiment E12--25--002, which was recently approved by the JLab PAC. Using a plane-wave theoretical model to generate quasi-data, we find the experiment could achieve a result of $|\\alpha_{J/\\psi~p}| = 3.08\\pm 0.45~\\mathrm{mfm}$, an uncertainty competitive with that of the free-proton measurement.

These measurements provide invaluable information about the properties of cold, catalyzed matter beyond nuclear saturation density. Here we present the results of our modeling of NICER data on PSR J0437$-$4715 using several different models of hot thermal X-ray emitting spots on the stellar surface. For this pulsar, previous Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) observations established that there is also a modulated nonthermal component to the emission, but the previously published analysis of NICER data did not model this component. We find that the Bayesian evidence is significantly higher when the modulated nonthermal component is included, and that omission of this component leads to poor fits to the bolometric NICER data and thus risks bias in the resulting radius estimates. Our models, which we pursue to inferential convergence, therefore have modulated nonthermal emission, and our headline model has in addition three uniform-temperature thermally-emitting circular spots. Using this model, the symmetric 68% credible range in the radius is 11.8 km to 15.1 km, which at the independently-measured mass of $M=1.418\\pm 0.044~M_\\odot$ is consistent with previous reports of the radius of the $\\sim 1.4~M_\\odot$ pulsar PSR J0030$+$0451.

Our results demonstrate excellent agreement with empirical R-matrix phase shifts in the 2S1/2 and 2P3/2 channels, while revealing persistent discrepancies in the 2P1/2 channel for neutron energies above 5 MeV. To systematically investigate these discrepancies, we construct and analyze a simplified neutron–alpha toy model, demonstrating that these discrepancies are not due to the use of the Lüscher finite-volume method. Additionally, we revisit our three-nucleon (3N) force fitting procedure, explicitly incorporating neutron–alpha scattering data through comprehensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. This analysis confirms the stability of nuclear binding-energy predictions and highlights the need for further refinements in the lattice N3LO three-nucleon forces to fully describe neutron–alpha scattering in the challenging 2P1/2 channel."

The jet-like yield is defined by the particle density in the toward region (∣Δφ∣ < π/3) after subtracting that in the transverse region (π/3 < ∣Δφ∣ < 2π/3). The activity on the transverse side is used as a proxy for medium-like effects. Three different Monte Carlo event generators—Pythia8, a multiphase transport (AMPT) model, and EPOS4—are employed to investigate particle yields as a function of in the interval 0.5–20 GeV/c. Calculations are performed for the pT threshold of 0.5 GeV/c at mid-rapidity (∣η∣ < 0.8). The jet-like yield in the toward region for pp collisions show interesting dynamics; they are significantly affected by the medium-like effects in the low to intermediate (<8 GeV/c) which is studied through color reconnection and hydrodynamics in Pythia8 and EPOS4, respectively. However, the results from AMPT show that the jet-like yield is medium-like modified throughout the entire range. The jet-like yield in p–Pb collisions using AMPT is also studied. Notably, a dip structure that is observed in the jet-like signal ratio of pp to p–Pb at low in ALICE data, is reproduced by AMPT model with SM on, pointing to possible medium-like behavior in small systems. The results of this article also underscore the importance of high- ( 8 GeV/c) for minimizing underlying event biases in jet-related studies."
