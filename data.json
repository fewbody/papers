      "summary": "arXiv:2504.04026v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The astrophysical factor $S_{18}$ for the $^{8}$B($p$,$\\gamma$)$^{9}$C has indirectly been measured with the proton removal reactions from $^9$C, elastic breakup of $^9$C off a heavy target, and transfer reactions. Quite recently, the elastic breakup cross section data were reanalyzed with the continuum-discretized coupled channels method (CDCC) assuming a $p+{\\rm ^{8}B}$ two-body model for $^9$C and the $S_{18}$ was modified. It was not well justified, however, to treat $^8$B as an inert nucleus given its proton separation energy is only 137~keV. We reexamine the elastic breakup of $^9$C by the four-body CDCC with a $p+p+{\\rm ^{7}Be}$ three-body model for $^9$C and evaluate $S_{18}$. To achieve this, we propose a method to disentangle the $p+{\\rm ^{8}B}+{\\rm ^{208}Pb}$ three-body channel in the four-body CDCC calculation, for the first time. We calculate the elastic breakup cross section of $^9$C off a $^{208}$Pb target at 65~MeV/nucleon. The obtained breakup cross sections are decomposed into the contributions of the $p+{\\rm ^{8}B}+{\\rm ^{208}Pb}$ and $p+p+{\\rm ^{7}Be}+{\\rm ^{208}Pb}$ channels by using the solution of the complex-scaled Lippmann--Schwinger equation. The breakup cross section to the $p+{\\rm ^{8}B}+{\\rm ^{208}Pb}$ channel reproduces well the shape of the experimental data in the low breakup energy region, which is important for determining $S_{18}$. By fitting the theoretical result to the experimental data, the asymptotic normalization coefficient of $^9$C for the $p+{\\rm ^{8}B}$ configuration is determined and we obtain $S_{18}=38.4\\pm1.1$ eVb. This result is smaller than the previous value obtained with the three-body CDCC by about 45\\%. Thus, our new results suggest the necessity of taking into account the fragile nature of $^{8}$B in the $^{9}$C breakup."

We provide a novel and practical paradigm for developing physics-driven machine learning in nuclear physics research by introducing known decay theory and statistical correlation analysis. Furthermore, this analysis verifies the Geiger-Nuttall law, and the relationship between the decay energy and {\\alpha} formation amplitude, also releases a signal that nuclei with hexadecapole deformation are more likely to form {\\alpha} clusters. In particular, we identify two novel phenomena, shape inheritance, in which the deformation properties are partially transmitted from parent to daughter nuclei; and half-life inversion due to shape staggering of adjacent even-even nuclei. This phenomenon occurs frequently in neutron-deficient nuclei near lead isotopes, which is consistent with shape coexistence in experiments. Surprisingly, it reappeared within the predicted half-life of the 119 and 120 isotope chains in the eighth period of the periodic table. The half-life considering the inversion effect is preferable for the study of new nuclides and shape coexistence in experiments."

Our formalism incorporates the attractive Coulomb force between the $\\Omega^{-}$ and proton, treating the system as three non-identical particle pairs (the $ABC$ model). In this study, we assess the impact of the Coulomb interaction on the system and compare our results with recent $\\Omega NN$ ($AAC$ model) calculations obtained using various approaches. The $ABC$ model yields low-energy characteristics for the \\(\\Omega NN\\) system that differ from previous calculations. The Coulomb potential has a marginal perturbative effect on the $AAC$ system, shifting the three-body binding energy by the Coulomb energy of the two-body $BC$ subsystem, but only slightly deviating the spatial configuration from isosceles triangle symmetry. These effects are primarily driven by the strong \\(\\Omega N\\) interaction. We demonstrate that the large binding energy of the $\\Omega^{-} np$ system arises from the short-range behavior of the $\\Omega N$ potentials."

However, the three-dimensional coordinate-space calculation of the phases is computationally demanding. We aim to generalize the Fermi Operator Expansion (FOE) method that is effective for finite-temperature coordinate-space simulation, from the Hartree-Fock theory to Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theory including the pairing effects. Furthermore, the periodic structure with free neutrons in the inner crust requires us to treat the system with the band theory. We give a concise proof that the generalized density matrix in the HFB theory can be obtained with the FOE. The Chebyshev polynomial expansion is used for calculations of the HFB band theory. Using a model for a slab phase of the inner crust, the FOE method produces results in good agreement with those based on the diagonalization of the HFB Hamiltonian. The FOE method for the HFB band theory is a powerful tool for studying the non-trivial exotic structures in neutron stars. The FOE method is suitable for parallelization and further acceleration is possible with nearsightedness."

Recent studies suggest that at least large pairing gaps in the CFL phase are incompatible with current astrophysical observations of neutron stars. At the same time, it has recently been shown that in two-flavor quark matter, subleading corrections from pairing effects can be much larger than would be na\\\"ively expected, even for comparatively small gaps. In the present Letter, we compute next-to-leading-order corrections to the pressure of quark matter in the CFL phase arising from the gap and the strong coupling constant, incorporating neutron-star equilibrium conditions and current state-of-the-art perturbative QCD results. We find that the corrections are again quite sizable, and they allow us to constrain the CFL gap in the quark energy spectrum to $\\Delta_{\\rm CFL} \\lesssim 140~{\\rm MeV}$ at a baryon chemical potential $\\mu_{\\rm B} = 2.6~{\\rm GeV}$, even when allowing for a wide range of possible behaviors for the dependence of the gap on the chemical potential."

When adding only one resonance, the best result is to add one $N(3/2^-)$ resonance around $2097$ MeV, which substantially reduce the $\\chi^2$ per degree of freedom to $1.35$. There are two best solutions when adding two resonances, one is to add one $N^\\ast(3/2^-)$ and one $N^\\ast(7/2^-)$, the other is to add one $N^\\ast(3/2^-)$ and one $\\Delta^\\ast(7/2^-)$, leading the $\\chi^2$ per degree of freedom to be $1.10$ and $1.09$, respectively.

Using correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge (CG), we computed the quasi-TMD beam function for a pion with a mass of 300 MeV, a fine lattice spacing of $a = 0.06$ fm and multiple large momenta up to 3 GeV. The intrinsic soft functions in the CG approach are extracted from form factors with large momentum transfer, and as a byproduct, we also obtain the corresponding Collins-Soper (CS) kernel. Our determinations of both the soft function and the CS kernel agree with perturbation theory at small transverse separations ($b_\\perp$) between the quarks. At larger $b_\\perp$, the CS kernel remains consistent with recent results obtained using both CG and gauge-invariant TMD correlators in the literature. By combining next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) factorization of the quasi-TMD beam function and the soft function, we obtain $x$-dependent pion valence-quark TMDPDF for transverse separations $b_\\perp \\gtrsim 1$ fm. Interestingly, we find that the $b_\\perp$ dependence of the phenomenological parameterizations of TMDPDF for moderate values of $x$ are in reasonable agreement with our QCD determinations.

The theoretical model parameters are determined by fitting them to the total cross sections of the process $e^+e^-\\to B \\bar{B}$, and it is found that the current experimental data on the baryon electromagnetic form factors in the time-like region can be well reproduced. In addition to the total cross sections, the electromagnetic form factors $G_E$ and $G_M$, and the charge radii of those baryons are also estimated, which are in agreement with the experimental data. On the other hand, we have also investigated the nonmonotonic behavior of the time-like baryon electromagnetic form factors, and it is found that the previously proposed periodic behaviour of the nucleon time-like electromagnetic form factor is not confirmed. However, we do observe the nonmonotonic structures in the line shape of the baryon effective form factors or the ratio $|G_E/G_M|$ for the charmed baryon $\\Lambda^+_c$. These features can be naturally explained by incorporating contributions from excited vector states. More precise measurements of the $e^+e^-\\to B \\bar{B}$ reaction offer a valuable opportunity to probe the properties of excited vector states, which are at present poorly known.

The intertwined confinement and chiral dynamics is resolved within functional QCD, aiming for quantitative accuracy at larger densities. Specifically it is shown that the self-consistent resolution of the confining gluonic background is crucial in particular for even the qualitative properties of the cumulants. Our results are in quantitative agreement with lattice and functional QCD benchmarks at vanishing and small chemical potentials. Moreover, they offer novel insights in the dynamics at larger chemical potentials including the regime of the critical end point. A welcome by-product of this analysis is the computation of the Polyakov loop potential in finite density QCD, which, alongside the aforementioned observables, can be used as input and benchmark for effective theory computations at finite density."

Valence-space nuclear shell-model wavefunctions generated by the BIGSTICK code are mapped to qubit registers using the Jordan-Wigner mapping (12 qubits for the $p$-shell and 24 qubits for the $sd$-shell), from which measures of the many-body entanglement ($n$-tangles) and magic (non-stabilizerness) are determined. While exact evaluations of these measures are possible for nuclei with a modest number of active nucleons, Monte Carlo simulations are required for the more complex nuclei. The broadly-applicable Pauli-String $IZ$ exact (PSIZe-) MCMC technique is introduced to accelerate the evaluation of measures of magic in deformed nuclei (with hierarchical wavefunctions), by factors of $\\sim 8$ for some nuclei. Significant multi-nucleon entanglement is found in the $sd$-shell, dominated by proton-neutron configurations, along with significant measures of magic. This is evident not only for the deformed states, but also for nuclei on the path to instability via regions of shape coexistence and level inversion. These results indicate that quantum-computing resources will accelerate precision simulations of such nuclei and beyond."

More precise experimental measurements are needed to test the model calculations and determine the nature of these scalar and tensor mesons.

      "summary": "arXiv:2409.05454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the formation of a deconfined and thermalized state of partons, known as quark-gluon plasma (QGP), leads to enhanced production of strange hadrons in contrast to proton-proton (pp) collisions, which are taken as baseline. This observation is known as strangeness enhancement in heavy-ion collisions and is considered one of the important signatures that can signify the formation of QGP. However, in addition to strangeness enhancement, recent measurements hint at observing several heavy-ion-like features in high multiplicity pp collisions at energies available at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Alternatively, event shape observables, such as transverse spherocity, transverse sphericity, charged particle flattenicity, and relative transverse activity classifiers, can fundamentally separate hard interaction-dominated jetty events from soft isotropic events. These features of event shape observables can probe the observed heavy-ion-like features in pp collisions with significantly reduced selection bias and can bring all collision systems on equal footing. In this article, we present an extensive summary of the strange particle ratios to pions as a function of different event classifiers using the PYTHIA~8 model with color reconnection and rope hadronization mechanisms to understand the microscopic origin of strangeness enhancement in pp collisions and also prescribe the applicability of these event classifiers in the context of strangeness enhancement. Charged particle flattenicity is found to be most suited for the study of strangeness enhancement, and it shows a quantitative enhancement similar to that seen for the analysis based on the number of multi-parton interactions."

We first discuss the tensor decomposition in the presence of the magnetic field, which breaks rotational symmetry. Then, we analytically perform all the momentum integrations and numerically take the Landau level sum. We confirm that the imaginary part of the photon polarization tensor correctly reproduces the known result from the independent calculation. We utilize the Kramers-Kronig relation to estimate the real part numerically as a function of the momenta, the chemical potential, and the finite temperature. As an application, we consider the real photon limit and estimate the photon decay rate and the Stokes parameter in the hot and dense medium. We specifically quantify the difference between the X-mode and the O-mode with the polarization orthogonal and parallel to the magnetic field. As long as the magnetic field is weak, the decay rate of the X-mode photon is larger than that of the O-mode photon, while the O-mode becomes dominant due to the Landau level suppression of the X-mode at a strong magnetic field. We also find that the eigenmodes of the propagating photon change their polarization state with increasing density."

Through a different time-ordering, the two-body Green's function can also describe the propagation of two electrons or two holes. The corresponding poles are the double ionization potentials and double electron affinities of the system. In this work, a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the two-body particle-particle propagator is derived within the linear-response formalism using a pairing field and anomalous propagators. This framework allows us to compute kernels corresponding to different self-energy approximations ($GW$, $T$-matrix, and second-Born) as in the usual electron-hole case. The performance of these various kernels is gauged for singlet and triplet valence double ionization potentials using a set of 23 small molecules. The description of double core hole states is also analyzed."

Lett. 14, 8780 (2023)], we explore the generalization of the ground-state Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory (DFT) to the (singlet) excited states of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling. While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly-excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. Specifically, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting $v$-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals -- each state possessing a distinct correlation functional -- we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional."
