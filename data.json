Scr. 99 055305 (2024)], where we studied axial octupole shapes in two-quasiparticle states of even-even nuclei, we investigate this type of shapes in odd-mass and odd-odd well-deformed nuclei, using the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-BCS approach with selfconsistent blocking and a constraint on the expectation value $Q_{30}$ of the axial octupole moment operator. To interprete the pattern of the resulting deformation energy curve as a function of $Q_{30}$, we extend the perturbative mechanism of Ref. [1]. We deduce selection rules which can predict, from the single-particle spectra at $Q_{30} = 0$, whether in a given multiquasiparticle state the deformation energy curve has a local minimum at a vanishing or a finite value of $Q_{30}$. The predictions of this perturbative mechanism are compared with actual Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-BCS calculations with a constraint on the expectation value $Q_{30}$. Overall we obtain a qualitative agreement and we show that quantitative predictions are limited by the role of pairing correlations and strong octupole coupling between quasi-degenerate members of a single-particle parity doublet."

Here we analyze this phase of matter within fully self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations using Skyrme-type energy density functionals for the mean field and a separable interaction in the pairing channel. The periodicity of the lattice is taken into account using Bloch boundary conditions, in order to describe the interplay between band structure and superfluidity. A relative flow between the clusters and the surrounding neutron gas is introduced in a time-independent way. As a consequence, the complex order parameter develops a phase, and in the rest frame of the superfluid one finds a counterflow between neutrons inside and outside the clusters. The neutron superfluid fraction is computed from the resulting current. Our results indicate that at densities above 0.03 fm$^{-3}$, more than 90% of the neutrons are effectively superfluid, independently of the detailed choice of the interaction, cluster charge, and lattice geometry. This fraction is only slightly lower than the one obtained recently within linear response theory on top of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer approximation, and it approaches the hydrodynamic limit for strong pairing. As a consequence, it is likely that the inner crust alone can provide a sufficient superfluid angular momentum reservoir to explain pulsar glitches."

While the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF) theory, an \\textit{ab initio,} non-perturbative nuclear many-body theory starting from realistic interactions, accurately describes nuclear matter properties near the saturation density $\\rho_0 \\approx 0.16$ fm$^{-3}$, its applicability is currently limited to densities up to $3 \\rho_0$, necessitating a reliable extrapolation to higher densities. In this work, we employ supervised machine learning to train thousands of fully connected neural networks on low-density RBHF data. By enforcing thermodynamic consistency and smoothness, we finally select a subset of 264 optimal models. These models employ the Swish activation function, which we identify as the most reliable choice for stable extrapolation after extensive testing and comparison. Using these models to extend the EOS over the full density range, we obtain the nuclear matter symmetry energy and then compute the neutron star mass-radius relation and tidal deformability, which are in a great harmony with current astronomical observations. The corresponding extrapolation uncertainty originates from the combined contributions of both the 264 optimal models and the linear regression on nuclear matter EOS, yielding a symmetry energy of $E\\mathrm{_{sym}(5\\rho_0)=136.0 \\pm 52.8 MeV}$, a pressure of $P(5\\rho_0) = 346.3 \\pm 97.4 \\mathrm{MeV/fm^{3}}$, a maximum neutron star mass of $M\\mathrm{_{max}=2.18 \\pm 0.18} M_{\\odot}$, and a tidal deformability of $\\Lambda_{1.4M_\\odot} = 532 \\pm 34$.

The present study investigates the spin alignment of quarkonia induced by dissociation mechanisms arising from medium effects imposed on quarkonia. We implement an effective Hamiltonian with a medium-modified color-singlet potential to incorporate the coupling of quarkonium spin with medium vorticity. This coupling gives rise to spin-dependent dissociation, which we identify as a plausible mechanism contributing to quarkonium spin alignment. Within the ambit of second-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics, we calculate the spin-dependent decay widths of charmonium ($J/\\psi$, $\\psi$(2S)) and bottomonium ($\\Upsilon$(1S), $\\Upsilon$(2S)) in a rotating thermal medium, including collisional damping and gluonic dissociation effects. We evaluate the observable $\\rho_{00}$ for Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV as a function of transverse momentum of the quarkonia, charged particle multiplicity, and medium rotation. The results demonstrate that medium vorticity modifies the quarkonia net decay width and, as a consequence, quarkonia spin alignment gets modified. These findings suggest new directions for understanding spin transport and the microscopic dynamics of vortical QGP."

Within the QIBP framework, residuals between the theoretical and experimental mass values are mapped into wave functions in Hilbert space. The corresponding potentials are obtained by solving the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. Assuming that the residuals follow a Boltzmann distribution, the prior and likelihood probability density functions (PDFs) can be obtained from potentials. Finally, the Bayesian theorem is applied to derive the posterior PDF for estimating the target nuclear mass residuals. Global optimization and extrapolation analyses indicate that the QIBP algorithm effectively captures quantum effects and subtle patterns, which are not fully incorporated into theoretical models, thereby providing reliable predictions. In addition, the extrapolation based on the synthetic experimental set further evaluates the performance and applicability of the QIBP algorithm across the entire nuclear chart. Furthermore, the QIBP algorithm is applied to predict $\\alpha$-decay energies of Ra and Es isotopes, and the shell effects manifested in these isotopes are analyzed. This study validates the feasibility of quantum machine learning in nuclear mass research, and demonstrates that the proposed algorithm can accurately describe nuclear masses, with potential applications in other areas of nuclear physics."

However, the ground-state energies of the hydrogen isotopes ${}^6$H and ${}^7$H are not yet well constrained, with substantial discrepancies across experimental analyses and theoretical predictions. Using ab initio nuclear lattice effective field theory with an ensemble of 282 chiral two- and three-nucleon forces, we perform an uncertainty-quantified analysis of the ground-state energies of ${}^6$H and ${}^7$H. The marginal posteriors suggest single-neutron separation energy $S_n({}^{7}\\text{H})=0.35^{+0.32}_{-0.32}$ MeV, disfavoring sequential ${}^{6}\\mathrm{H}+n$ decay and pointing towards direct $t+4n$ emission. Intrinsic densities indicate triton- and $\\alpha$-like clusters in ${}^7$H and ${}^8$He, respectively. By computing two-body and reduced four-body correlation functions, we find that the valence neutrons in the surface region of these systems form compact dineutrons that predominantly organize into symmetric dineutron-dineutron configurations, with only a small but non-negligible fraction assembling into more compact tetraneutron-like substructures. In ${}^7$H, these components account for roughly 95% and 5% of the sampled four-neutron configurations, respectively, and ${}^8$He exhibits a similar hierarchy. For these configurations, we also extract the corresponding spatial and angular correlation patterns among the nucleons. These results provide nuclear-structure insights into the debate surrounding four-neutron clusters and complement ongoing experimental searches for tetraneutron signatures in light nuclei."

A harmonic analysis of the correlation functions reveals in particular a dominant quadrupole component in $^{20}$Ne, consistent with a bowling-pin picture, and a prominent triangular modulation in $^{16}$O, possibly indicative of alpha-cluster correlations. Given that such structures can be accurately identified in high-energy collider experiments, these findings open a new paradigm for analyzing emergent collective behavior in atomic nuclei, relating their intrinsic shapes to the harmonic spectrum of microscopic correlations."

The different deformation and coupling effects, such as triaxial $\\gamma$, reflection-asymmetric $\\beta_{3}$ and high-order $\\beta_{6}$ deformations, are discussed for both ground state and isomeric state based on the corresponding potential-energy curves along the fission valley. In particular, it is pointed out for the first time that possible multipath decay, e.g., from the high-$K$ isomeric state to those states formed between potential energy surfaces of this isomeric state and the ground state during the fission process, may reduce the nuclear lifetime and balance the fission stability. These results elucidate not only the enhanced stability of the high-$K$ isomeric state, including the inversion of stability between it and the ground state, but also the limitation of the stability increase of such an isomeric state."

This enables controlled numerical studies of the mutual conversion between spin and orbital angular momentum, a central feature of relativistic spin hydrodynamics driven by the rotational viscous effect. We present two physical scenarios with a rotating fluid confined in a cylindrical container: one case in which initial orbital angular momentum is converted into spin angular momentum in analogy with the Barnett effect, and the opposite case in which initial spin angular momentum is converted into orbital angular momentum in analogy with the Einstein-de Haas effect. We investigate these conversion processes governed by the rotational viscous effect by analyzing the spacetime profiles of thermal vorticity and spin potential. Our PINNs-based framework provides the first numerical evidence for spin-orbit angular momentum conversion with fully nonlinear computational relativistic spin hydrodynamics."

This approach allows us to include the crucial Upsilon term in the wave equations, which for the point-like nucleus is proportional to delta(r) and was ignored in the previous calculations of the energy spectrum. Several unusual effects emerge: (i) The Upsilon term supports a tower of states located mainly inside the nucleus. As R -> 0 their number diverges, most lying in the negative energy continuum (energy epsilon  0.\n  (iii) Charge density of a negatively charged vector particle changes sign in a vicinity of the nucleus and becomes positive charge density, whereas the Upsilon term ensures its density inside the nucleus remains negative.\n  (iv) For weak coupling, Z alpha << 1, yet with mR << mR.\n  These phenomena highlight the distinctive and subtle behaviour of spin-1 particles in the Coulomb field."

By testing general formal considerations against lattice data, it can be shown that thermally modified versions of stable vacuum particles, so-called thermoparticles, form the constituents of thermal quantum field theories, with properties quite different from what is expected perturbatively.

Permitting explicit first-order phase transitions allows us to systematically search for twin-star solutions, i.e. the existence of stars degenerate in mass but differing in radius. We find that current observational constraints exclude all but two classes of twin stars. The first is characterized by a first-order transition occurring at a very low density, where the material properties of the system either stay largely intact or move away from the conformal limit. In the second, more interesting class, the discontinuity in the mass-radius curve emerges after a rapid crossover transition at a significantly higher density, with the speed of sound exhibiting two sharp peaks at distinct densities. Since neither class shows clear conformalization upon entering the second branch, the standard twin-star scenario linking the mass-radius discontinuity to deconfinement can be firmly ruled out, while even the remaining solutions -- disfavored by per-mille Bayes factors and in tension with theoretical bounds -- are likely to be excluded in the future."

In this work, we introduce a complementary universality paradigm based on trigonometric continuous-variable gates, which enable a Fourier-like representation of bosonic operators and are particularly well suited for periodic and non-perturbative interactions. We present a deterministic ancilla-based method for implementing unitary and non-unitary trigonometric gates whose arguments are arbitrary Hermitian functions of qumode quadratures. As a concrete application, we develop a hybrid qubit-qumode quantum simulation of the lattice sine-Gordon model. Using these gates, we prepare ground states via quantum imaginary-time evolution, simulate real-time dynamics, compute time-dependent vertex two-point correlation functions, and extract quantum kink profiles under topological boundary conditions. Our results demonstrate that trigonometric continuous-variable gates provide a physically natural framework for simulating interacting field theories on near-term hybrid quantum hardware, while establishing a parallel route to universality beyond polynomial gate constructions.

Importantly, we relate isospin symmetry to the QCD flavour symmetry, and we present both conceptual and analytical proofs demonstrating the equality of the mean multiplicities of charged and neutral kaons for an initial ensemble of colliding systems that is invariant under charge-symmetry transformation."
