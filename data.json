This problem is addressed in the interacting boson model with configuration mixing that is formulated by using the nuclear energy density functional theory.

However, $\\Xi NN$ 3BF based on SU(3) chiral EFT has not been studied until now.\n  Purpose: We apply SU(3) chiral EFT for the first time to derive $\\Xi NN$ potentials in momentum space. Then, we investigate how the $\\Xi NN$ 3BF affects the correlation function of deuteron-$\\Xi^-$ pair created through heavy-ion collisions.\n  Methods: To reduce the number of low-energy constants involved in the $\\Xi NN$ potentials, we employ the decuplet saturation approximation, by which only two of them remain unconstrained.\n  Results: We found that the effect of the $\\Xi NN$ 3BF on the deuteron-$\\Xi^-$ correlation function is at most about 4%. This is because the deuteron and $\\Xi^-$ interact with each other mainly at low momentum, corresponding to peripheral scattering, where the influence of the $\\Xi NN$ 3BF is limited.\n  Conclusions: High-momentum scattering of the deuteron off $\\Xi^-$ is expected to be a promising probe of the $\\Xi NN$ 3BF, offering an alternative to femtoscopic analyses of the correlation function."

In this paper, we systematically investigate the in-medium structure changes of $\\rho^+$ mesons within the covariant Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, utilizing the Schwinger proper-time regularization scheme. We solve the Bethe-Salpeter equations to guarantee the bound meson-state condition. At the quark level, the nuclear medium effects are also derived within the same NJL model to maintain a consistent approach with the in-medium $\\rho^+$ meson electromagnetic form factors. To this end, we analyze the spacelike electromagnetic form factors of the $\\rho^+$ meson in free space and in a nuclear medium. We find that the charge radius and quadrupole moment of the $\\rho^+$ meson increase with increasing nuclear matter density, while the magnetic moment decreases, in agreement with the existing previous theoretical predictions. The enhancement of the $\\rho^+$ meson charge radius at normal density relative to that in free space is about 11\\% (0.08 fm), while the reduction of $\\rho^+$ meson magnetic moment is about 8\\% (0.20 $\\mu_N$).

Toward this end, we set up a semiclassical transport approach that combines nonperturbative reaction rates rooted in lattice-constrained $T$-matrix interactions with a viscous hydrodynamic medium evolution. Bottomonium suppression is computed along trajectories in the hydrodynamic evolution while regeneration is evaluated via a rate equation extended to a medium with spatial gradients. The much larger reaction rates compared to previous calculations markedly enhance both dissociation and regeneration processes. This, in particular, requires a reliable assessment of bottomonium equilibrium limits and of the non-thermal distributions of the bottom quarks transported through the expanding medium. Within current uncertainties our approach can describe the centrality dependence of bottomonium yields measured in Pb-Pb ($\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}}$=5.02\\,TeV) collisions at the LHC, while discrepancies are found at large transverse momenta."

We show how to determine sections of the attractor on slices of constant proper time, and point out that in conformal models one may choose a parametrisation of the extended phase space such that the intersection of the attractor with a slice of constant proper time is the same on all slices. In consequence, it is possibleto project these intersections and one finds that the result reproduces the attractor solution. This projection allows for an expressive picture of hydrodynamisation, but the attractor can be equally well described without taking advantage of this convenience. An immediate implication of these observations is that conformal symmetry does not play a significant role in the emergence of early-time attraction. We illustrate this by describing the hydrodynamic attractor in a simple model where conformal symmetry is broken by the equation of state. Our findings can be applied to studies of hydrodynamic attractors in more general situations, also beyond the context of quark-gluon plasma dynamics."

This effective interaction is a common ingredient of all relevant dynamical equations, and accommodates the crucial mass differences between the various quark flavours. Particular attention is paid to the nonperturbative determination of the quark-photon vertex. The computed electromagnetic form factors for the pion and the kaon mesons show excellent agreement with experimental determinations. In addition, the predictions for the charge radii of heavy-light systems are in overall good agreement with lattice QCD."

Deep learning methods enable per-jet evaluation of these modifications, enhancing the use of jets as precision probes of the nuclear medium. In this work, we predict the jet-by-jet fractional energy loss $\\chi$ for jets evolving through a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium using a Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) model. To approximate realistic experimental conditions, we embed medium-modified jets in a thermal background and apply Constituent Subtraction for background removal. Two network architectures are studied: convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using jet images, and dynamic graph convolutional neural networks (DGCNNs) using particle clouds. We find that CNNs achieve accurate predictions for background-free jets but degrade in the presence of the QGP background and remain below the background-free baseline even after background subtraction. In contrast, DGCNNs applied to background-subtracted particle clouds maintain high accuracy across the entire $\\chi$ range, demonstrating the advantage of point-cloud-based graph neural networks that exploit full jet structure under realistic conditions."

The region between the most massive neutron star and the least massive black hole is called the mass-gap. If indeed its existence is confirmed by future observations, that indicates a gap in our understanding which seeks for explanation. In addition, the existence of compact objects within the mass-gap should also be supported with the help of possible new theoretical scenarios. In this study, we propose a possible explanation for the existence of compact objects within the mass-gap region. Specifically, we propose that the mass-gap region could be bridged by the existence of a hybrid compact object, composed of hadronic and self interacting and non-annihilating fermionic dark matter, considering that the interaction between these two fluids it is only gravitational. Fundamental questions about how these objects form and how they can be detected are also addressed."
