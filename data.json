In this work, we present the first next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) chiral forces on the lattice with the isospin-breaking effects fully taken into account. We focus on both the charge-independence breaking (CIB) and charge-symmetry breaking (CSB) effects. Specifically, we include the isospin-breaking effect from the mass difference between the charged and neutral pions in the one-pion-exchange potential (OPEP), the Coulomb force for the $pp$ interaction and the contribution of two additional charge-dependent contact operators. We also explicitly incorporate the two-pion-exchange potentials which was mostly neglected in previous NLEFT calculations. With these improvements, we are able to accurately reproduce the $np$ and $pp$ scattering phase shifts up to relative momentum $p \\sim 200$ MeV as well as the deuteron properties. The construction of these charge-dependent lattice nuclear forces establishes a solid foundation for future high-precision nuclear ab initio calculations within the NLEFT framework."

Extending the recently formulated effective field theory for weakly bound Borromean nuclei, we incorporate corrections arising from the effective range of neutron-neutron scattering and evaluate their impact on the mean-square radii and electromagnetic response. In particular, we compute the ratio of the matter and charge radii, the shape of the $E1$ dipole strength function, and the electric polarizability. Our results indicate that these corrections remain numerically small when the two-neutron separation energy of the Borromean nucleus is much less than 1~MeV."

By employing a second-order expansion of the statistical operator in terms of hydrodynamic gradients, we demonstrate that new second-order terms emerge due to the coupling of two-point quantum correlators between tensors of differing ranks, evaluated at distinct space-time points. Such terms arise because the presence of the acceleration vector in the system allows Curie's theorem, which governs symmetry constraints, to be extended for constructing invariants from tensors of different ranks evaluated at distinct space-time points. The new terms are identified in the context of a complete set of second-order equations governing the shear-stress tensor, bulk-viscous pressure, and charge-diffusion currents for a generic quantum system characterized by the energy-momentum tensor and multiple conserved charges. Additionally, we identify the transport coefficients associated with these new terms and derive the Kubo formulas expressing the second-order transport coefficients through two- and three-point correlation functions."

Understanding how nuclear interactions shape the dUrca threshold is essential for interpreting neutron star thermal evolution, particularly in light of recent studies on exceptionally cold objects. We investigate the impact of incorporating the scalar isovector $\\delta$ meson into the neutron star equation of state, which alters the internal proton fraction and consequently affects the dUrca cooling threshold. Since proton superfluidity is known to suppress dUrca rates, we also examine the interplay between the nuclear interaction mediated by the $\\delta$ meson and the $^1S_0$ proton pairing gap. We perform a Bayesian analysis using models built within a relativistic mean-field approximation, incorporating constraints from astrophysical observations, nuclear experiments, and known results of \\textit{ab initio} calculations of pure neutron matter. We then impose a constraint on the dUrca threshold based on studies of fast-cooling neutron stars. The inclusion of $\\delta$ meson expands the range of possible internal compositions, directly influencing the stellar mass required for the central density to reach the dUrca threshold. Furthermore, we observe that the observation of relatively young and cold neutron stars provides insights into $^1S_0$ proton superfluidity in the core of neutron stars."

In the absence of sufficient dissipation, this instability emerges within the hydrodynamic regime, depending on the interplay between shear viscosity and the anomalous vortical contribution to the stress-energy tensor at second order in hydrodynamic expansion. We show that this instability generates helical flows and name it the {\\it chiral vortical instability} (CVI). Alongside the chiral plasma and magnetovortical instabilities, CVI tends to transfer initial microscopic chirality into macroscopic helicities, which combine into a generalized axial charge. We further find that an elementary static Gromeka-Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, corresponding to a CSW at a specific momentum, solves the full nonlinear equations of second-order chiral hydrodynamics, whereas global rotation of a chiral medium is not a solution. This observation supports the relevance of CVI beyond the hydrodynamic regime. Finally, we briefly note that CVI may have multiple phenomenological implications across various systems, including QCD matter produced in heavy-ion collisions and primordial plasma in the early Universe."

Angular distribution for the $^{6}$He-$n$ decay of the $^{7}$He $3/2^-$ ground state can be explained by a strong spin alignment induced by a reaction mechanism. The correlation information for the higher-lying $^{7}$He excitations is available as backward-forward asymmetry for the $^{6}$He-$n$ decay in the $^{7}$He frame. The asymmetry function has an expressed energy profile which may be explained by using quite restrictive assumptions about structure of $^{7}$He excitations or/and peculiarities of the reaction mechanism.

We show how these corrections turn out to be essential to accurately extract the strong hadron-hadron scattering amplitudes from CF data. We compare the obtained expressions for the CFs with those reported in previous theoretical frameworks. Also, using proton-proton systems as a case study, we obtain a good comparison of our results with previous realistic theoretical calculations and with accurate recent data from the ALICE experiment.

Particles oriented in the direction in which the QCD medium formed in these collisions is shorter, suffer less energy loss, and thus, are over-represented in the final ensemble compared to those oriented in the direction in which the medium is longer. In this work we present the first semi-analytical predictions, including propagation through a realistic, hydrodynamical background, of the azimuthal anisotropies for jets, obtaining a quantitative agreement with available experimental data as function of the jet $p_T$, its cone size $R$ and the collisions centrality. Jets are multi-partonic, extended objects and their energy loss is sensitive to substructure fluctuations. This is determined by the physics of color coherence that relates to the ability of the medium to resolve those partonic fluctuations. Namely, color dipoles whose angle is smaller than a critical angle, $\\theta_c$, are not resolved by the medium and they effectively act as a coherent source of energy loss. We find that jet azimuthal anisotropies have a specially strong dependence on coherence physics due to the marked length-dependence of $\\theta_c$. By combining our predictions for the collision systems and center of mass energies studied at RHIC and the LHC, covering a wide range of typical values of $\\theta_c$, we show that the relative size of jet azimuthal anisotropies for jets with different cone-sizes $R$ follow a universal trend that indicates a transition from a coherent regime of jet quenching to a decoherent regime. These results suggest a way forward to reveal the role played by the physics of jet color decoherence in probing deconfined QCD matter."

      "summary": "arXiv:2409.09019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We employ the Zubarev approach of the non-equilibrium statistical operator to investigate the enhancement of the low-$p_T$ region of pion spectra, introducing an effective pion chemical potential to describe the overpopulation of low-energy pion states. We test a corresponding freeze-out approach by analyzing the transverse-momentum spectra of identified particles measured recently with high precision by the ALICE Collaboration in Pb+Pb collisions at CERN LHC. A blast-wave model and a blast-wave-based particle generator, coupled to a hadronic transport model, are utilized. Bayesian inference methods are applied to extract the most probable sets of thermodynamic parameters at the chemical freeze-out hypersurface. Both models for the overpopulated pion states, the hadronic transport model and the thermal model with a nonzero pion chemical potential, provide a satisfactory description of the observed pion spectra. However, both approaches contain approximations which can be improved within a systematic nonequilibrium approach. We demonstrate that the introduction of a nonequilibrium pion chemical potential offers an efficient alternative to the conventional explanation of the low-$p_T$ enhancement, typically attributed to resonance decays with subsequent thermalization. A similar discussion holds also for the kaon spectra."

      "summary": "arXiv:2410.18498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: A recent analysis on the properties of the XTE J1814-338 pulsar yielded a small radius value around ~ 7 km. Notably, this estimation is significantly lower compared to the currently inferred values for the radius of neutron stars (as they are derived from both theoretical calculations and corresponding observations). In this paper, we focus on the construction of hybrid equations of state (EOSs) for the possible reconciliation of the exotic XTE J1814-338 properties. Our analysis indicates that an equation of state involving a sufficiently strong phase transition could potentially lead to the explanation of the size and mass of such a compact object. By examining the sign of the $dM/dP_c$ slope, we found that stellar configurations compatible to XTE J1814-338 are only stable for a \"stiff\" low density phase. For a \"soft\" hadronic EOS selection the stability of the resulting configurations may not be satisfied in terms of the turning point criterion. However, a complementary analysis, for the radial oscillations of the aforementioned configurations, indicated their stability when a slow phase conversion is considered."

      "summary": "arXiv:2411.17828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Charge-conjugation and parity violation in strong interaction for cold dense quark matter is studied with axions of quantum chromodynamic within the three flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model that includes the coupling of axions to quarks. We first calculate the effective potential for axions at finite baryon density and zero temperature including the effects of a first order chiral phase transition. Using the equation of state for quark matter with axions and a hadronic matter equation of state in the ambit of a relativistic mean field theory in quantum hadrodynamics, we discuss the hadron-quark phase transition. Inclusion of axions reduces the critical density for chiral transition. We use a Gibbs construct for the hadron-quark phase transition satisfying the constraints of beta equilibrium and charge neutrality as appropriate for the neutron star matter. The equation of state so obtained is used to investigate the structure of hybrid neutron stars. It is found that with the presence of axions, it is possible to have stable hybrid neutron stars having an inner core of quark matter both in pure quark matter phase as well as in a mixed phase with hyperonic matter along with a outer core of hyperonic matter and is in agreement with modern astrophysical constraints. We also discuss the properties of non-radial oscillations of such hybrid neutron stars. It is observed that the quadrupolar fundamental modes ($f$-modes) for such hybrid neutron stars get substantial enhancements both due to a larger quark core in the presence of axions and from the hyperons as compared to a canonical nucleonic neutron stars."

      "summary": "arXiv:2501.18159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: In the low-energy regime, baryons with $N_f \\geq 2$ have long been constructed as skyrmions or through bag models, but such constructions for $N_f = 1$ are hindered by the trivial topological structure of the meson field. Recent proposals suggest that one-flavor baryons can instead be interpreted as quantum Hall droplets on the $\\eta'$ domain wall, providing a potential link to quark--hadron continuity at high density. In retrospect, the qualitative or semi-qualitative construction of one-flavor baryons on the $\\eta'$ domain wall reveals that these baryons can be described as quantum Hall droplets, resembling topological solitons akin to skyrmions. Using an effective theory on the $\\eta'$ domain wall, which is conjectured to be the Chern--Simons--Higgs theory, it is discussed that its vortex solution with unit baryon numbers naturally has a spin of $N_c/2$, and thus can be interpreted as a baryon or multi-baryon structure. The particle--vortex duality suggests that quarks carry a fractional topological charge of $1/N_c$ and obey fractional statistics. In terms of chiral bag models, confinement can be attributed to the monopoles confined within the bag, and the vector meson fields on the bag surface are essential for ensuring the correct baryon number in the chiral bag framework, thereby providing deeper insights into baryons as non-trivial topological structures of the meson field. In this paper, we review the progress in this development, with a special focus on the $\\eta^\\prime$ domain wall dynamics. Naive extensions to $N_f \\geq 2$ are also discussed."

      "summary": "We investigate the chiral phase diagram in the NJL model with a modified coupling strength. Moreover, we delve deeply into the fluctuations of baryon numbers. A temperature damping factor for the coupling strength is introduced to mimic the temperature dependence of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in the low and middle temperature ranges. This novel parameter is fitted by using the quark condensate from lattice QCD at finite temperature. Our approach provides a significant enhancement to the chiral phase diagram, accurately reproducing the pseudocritical temperature at μB = 0 and aligning the crossover boundary with lattice QCD results. The quark condensate is used to ascertain the location of the phase transition, and we find an area where both phases coexist. The chiral susceptibility is employed to identify the pseudo-critical line in the crossover region. The skewness ratios and the kurtosis ratios varying with T at several different μB are calculated meticulously, and the results demonstrate that they experience a significant change around the pseudo-critical line. Additionally, the skewness ratios and the kurtosis ratios along the pseudo-critical line (Tc(μB)) and the lines deviating from Tc(μB) are computed to gain a better understanding of the experimental results. This implies that the freeze-out line is relatively far from the critical end point."
