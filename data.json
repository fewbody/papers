The collective level structure deduced from the subsequent γ decay of stopped isomeric fragments using the A1900 spectrometer and GRETINA array points to a sudden transition from axially prolate shapes in the lighter Ta isotopes to a strong triaxial shape for the 189Ta nucleus (Z=73, N=116; 8 neutrons more than stable 181Ta).

      "summary": "arXiv:2503.11889v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Background: The nuclear shell model offers realistic predictions of nuclear structure starting from (quasi-) proton and neutron degrees of freedom, but relies on coupling constants (interaction matrix elements) that must be fit to experiment. To extend the shell model's applicability across the nuclear chart, and specifically toward the driplines, we must first be able to efficiently test new interaction matrix elements and assign credible uncertainties.\n  Purpose: We develop and test a framework to efficiently fit new shell model interactions and obtain credible uncertainties. We further demonstrate its use by validating the uncertainty estimates of the known \\textit{sd}-shell effective interactions.\n  Methods: We use eigenvector continuation to emulate solutions to the exact shell model. First, we use the emulator to replicate earlier results using a well-known linear-combination chi-squared minimization algorithm. Then, we employ a modern Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to test for nonlinearities in the observable posterior distributions, which previous sensitivity analyses precluded.\n  Results: The emulator reproduces the USDB interaction within a small margin of error, allowing for the quantification of the matrix element uncertainty. However, we find that to obtain credible predictive intervals the model defect of the shell model itself, rather than experimental or emulator uncertainty/error, must be taken into account.\n  Conclusions: Eigenvector continuation can be used to accelerate fitting shell model interactions. We confirm that the linear approximation used to develop interactions in the past is indeed sufficient. However, we find that typical assumptions about the likelihood function must be modified in order to obtain a credible uncertainty-quantified interaction."

The two-stage abrasion-ablation model is used, with the abrasion stage described via the Glauber model, incorporating validated single-nucleon density distributions from proton elastic scattering data. In the ablation stage, where particle evaporation occurs, the contribution to charge-changing cross sections is estimated using two approaches. First, a statistical decay model is employed to analyze the evaporation of protons following neutron removal in the abrasion stage. The second approach estimates evaporation contributions by subtracting the direct process component (abrasion) from the experimental charge-changing cross section data. A comparison between these estimated contributions from the experimental data and the predictions of the statistical model enables a systematic evaluation of the evaporation process. The key factors influencing evaporation, such as excitation energy distribution parameters, decay width of the emitted particles, and nucleon separation energies, are analyzed. A strong correlation is observed between the maximum excitation energy available for evaporation and the neutron separation energy of the projectiles across different targets, highlighting the role of evaporation dynamics in the charge-changing cross sections."

Binding energies and neutron skin thicknesses are computed for a total of 14 neutron-rich Ge isotopes. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the RMF model's explanation of nuclear ground-state properties. Furthermore, we examine the $\\log ft$ values of the allowed $\\beta^\\pm$ decays and electron/positron capture rates on Ge isotopes in the mass region $A = 67\\text{--}80$. The proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA) method was employed to calculate the $\\beta$-decay properties of selected Ge isotopes. The calculated $\\log ft$ values show good consistency with the measured data. The predicted $\\beta$-decay half-lives are within a factor of 2 of the measured values. For high temperature and density conditions in the core of massive stars, the calculated pn-QRPA stellar rates are up to an order of magnitude larger than the independent shell model rates. The findings reported in this study could be valuable for simulating the late-stage stellar evolution of massive stars."

      "summary": "arXiv:2503.12812v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The existing intense laser-based approaches for nuclear excitation offer ultrafast temporal resolution and high efficiency compared to traditional accelerator probes. However, controlling nuclear properties such as spin and magnetic moment remains an unprecedented challenge. Here, we put forward a novel method for nuclear excitation and control induced by intense vortex lasers. We develop a theory incorporating the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of vortex laser within the nuclear hyperfine mixing framework. We find that intense vortex laser can effectively excite hydrogen-like thorium-229 nucleus and induce three-dimensional rotation of the nuclear magnetic moment. This rotation arises from the localized electromagnetic field and new transition channels excited by the vortex laser, and can be reconstructed through radiation spectrum analysis. Moreover, the OAM of vortex laser enables the chaotic system to exhibit topologically protected periodic patterns in nuclear excitation and radiation, facilitating precise experimental measurements. Our findings underscore the potential of vortex laser for high-precision nuclear control and imaging, deepening our understanding of nuclear properties and hyperfine structure, and advancing quantum information and nuclear technologies."

The difference between them stems from the treatment of the phonon excitation modes; those not adopted as boson excitation modes in the former mapping are adopted in the latter mapping. When the commutation relations among the phonon operators are closed among the excitation modes adopted as the boson excitation modes in the mapping after truncation, the mapping after and the mapping before truncation coincide, not depending on the types, Hermitian and non-Hermitian. We also investigate the Park operator, which judges whether a boson state vector is physical, and reveal that the conventional claim, which claims that it is applicable only when the mapping is that of the whole fermion space, is incorrect."

We calculate the self-energies and spectral functions of the $\\phi$ meson for these two Lagrangians at the one-loop level within the Matsubara formalism of finite-temperature quantum field theory, employing various parameters to represent different physical scenarios. Using these spectral functions, transport coefficients related to the spin alignment and tensor polarization are obtained, connecting the spin alignment of the $\\phi$ meson to hydrodynamic gradients. Using the standard freeze-out picture within the relativistic hydrodynamic model, we explore how the possible pattern of the spin alignment can be generated using these microscopically calculated spectral functions. We discover that, with certain assumptions, these simple microscopic model-based calculations can produce sizable spin alignments with a sign-flipping behavior in their $p_T$ and centrality dependence, similar to those observed in experiments."

In contrast, in heavy-ion collisions, parton showers interact with a spatially extended dense medium. This sets a reference length scale with respect to which the space-time ordering may be analysed. Here, we explore the possibility of identifying experimental signatures of the QCD formation time, $\\tau_f$, on the level of a single parton splitting. Since heavy flavour offers an additional handle on tracing the propagation of individual quarks through the medium, we focus on the $g\\to c\\bar{c}$ splitting. Combining adapted versions of the Cambridge-Aachen and FlavourCone jet finding algorithms with grooming techniques, we show how the kinematics of such splittings can be reconstructed with high fidelity using either final state partons or hadrons, and how the formation time distribution of parton splittings can be constructed therefrom. Medium modification leads to a characteristic modification of this $\\tau_f$ distribution. This effect can be used to construct experimentally-accessible ratios of $\\tau_f$ distributions, in which the sensitivity of the medium modification to the QCD formation time becomes measurable."

The determination is accurate to next-to-next-to-leading order in the strong coupling, and includes heavy quark mass corrections in the analysis of DIS data. Uncertainties due to missing higher-order corrections are systematically incorporated by means of a covariance matrix determined by scale variations. NNPDFpol2.0 is based on a machine learning methodology, that makes use of Monte Carlo sampling for the representation of uncertainties into PDFs, of a neural network for the parametrisation of PDFs, of stochastic gradient descent for the optimisation of PDF parameters, and of hyperoptimisation for the selection of the best fitting model. We study the impact on PDFs of higher-order corrections, of the positivity constraint, and of the data. We demonstrate two phenomenological applications of NNPDFpol2.0, specifically the determination of the proton spin fraction carried by gluons and quarks, and of theoretical predictions for single-hadron production in longitudinally polarised DIS and proton-proton collisions."

Model A predicts a stronger $\\phi N({}^2 S_{1/2})$ interaction and permits a two-body bound state, whereas Model B suggests the interaction is attractive but too weak to form a bound state. Both models predict bound states for the $I(J^P) = 0(0^-)$ and $0(1^-)$ $\\phi NN$ systems. In Model A, these states are deeply bound with binding energies exceeding 15 MeV and remain existent when considering parameter uncertainties.

At the resolution of the ILM, all of the rho meson TMDs are symmetric in parton x for fixed transverse momentum, and Gaussian-like in the transverse momentum for fixed parton x. The latter is a direct consequence of the profiling of the quark zero modes in the ILM.

In this paper we present a comprehensive discussion of its science objectives, providing state-of-the-art predictions for the capabilities of ET in both geometries currently under consideration, a single-site triangular configuration or two L-shaped detectors. We discuss the impact that ET will have on domains as broad and diverse as fundamental physics, cosmology, early Universe, astrophysics of compact objects, physics of matter in extreme conditions, and dynamics of stellar collapse. We discuss how the study of extreme astrophysical events will be enhanced by multi-messenger observations. We highlight the ET synergies with ground-based and space-borne GW observatories, including multi-band investigations of the same sources, improved parameter estimation, and complementary information on astrophysical or cosmological mechanisms obtained combining observations from different frequency bands. We present advancements in waveform modeling dedicated to third-generation observatories, along with open tools developed within the ET Collaboration for assessing the scientific potentials of different detector configurations. We finally discuss the data analysis challenges posed by third-generation observatories, which will enable access to large populations of sources and provide unprecedented precision."

Using the relativistic mean-field approximation with the QHD-ALP-DM framework, we compute the equation of state (EoS) of neutron stars. Based on our previous study, we find that typical ALP parameter values have no significant effect on the EoS. We then explore various parametrizations of this model by varying the DM Fermi momentum, $q_f$, and DM mass, $m_{\\chi}$. Our results show that increasing $q_f$ or $m_{\\chi}$ shifts the energy density to higher values while reducing the maximum mass, radius, and tidal deformability of neutron stars. Finally, comparison with observational constraints from gravitational wave events and pulsar measurements indicates that the allowed parameter space for this model is constrained to $q_f < 0.05$ MeV and $m_{\\chi} < 1000$ GeV. As a result, our study highlights the importance of next-generation gamma-ray observatories, such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), in probing the ALP-mediated DM model."

However, the masses of the systems are degenerate with orbital inclination angle when using solely gravitational waves (GWs) or electromagnetic measurements, especially for face-on binaries. Taking advantages of both GWs and optical observations for LISA neutron-star white-dwarf (NS-WD) binaries, we propose a mass determination method utilising multi-messenger observational information. By combining the binary mass function obtained from optical observations and a GW mass function, that we introduce, derived from GW observations, we demonstrate how we can set improved constraints on the NS mass and break the degeneracy in the mass and viewing inclination determination. We further comment on the universal relation of the error bar of the GW mass function versus GW signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and propose a simple method for the estimate of capability of GW observations on mass determination with {LISA}. We show that for ultra-compact NS-WD binaries within our Galaxy, the mass of the NS can be constrained to within an accuracy of +- 0.2 \\solarmass with the proposed method."

When these eight scalar functions are expanded in terms of velocities order by order, we can return to the non-relativistic effective potential systematically organized by velocities. By retaining the exact momentum dependence in the effective potential, we estimate its corrections to the energy spectrum of hydrogen using a highly precise numerical method. The comparison of the numerical results with those obtained using conventional bound-state perturbative theory is discussed. Our calculations suggest that it is possible to accurately account for all relativistic contributions using this method.

To such end, we consider the uncertainty due to the experimental error of the femtoscopic $\\Lambda p$ data used to fix the chiral hyperon-nucleon interaction and the theoretical uncertainty, estimated from the residual cut-off dependence of this interaction. We find that the final maximum mass of a neutron star with hyperons is in the range $1.3-1.4$ $M_\\odot$, in agreement with previous works. The hyperon puzzle, therefore, remains still an open issue if only two-body hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions are considered.

In the framework of thermal model, a strong evidence of strangeness imbalance is observed in the experiments at lower collision energies relative to non-strange particles, particularly pions. The study indicates that like mass particle ratios in the system at the chemical freeze-out in URHIC can be described effectively by considering baryons (antibaryons) as point like as well as finite size particles which imitates hard-core repulsive interactions leading to an excluded volume type effect. In this analysis, we employ the statistical hadron resonance gas model for both cases. A comparison between the two cases is provided. However, the importance of considering baryons (antibaryons) as finite size particles is revealed in the description of baryon to meson ratios. Best fits to particle ratios are obtained using χ2-minimization procedure. For the case of finite-size baryons (antibaryons), we find that considering their hard-core radii allows us to fit the available antibaryon-to-baryon and baryon (antibaryon)-to-pion ratio experimental data simultaneously quite well with the same model parameter values. Moreover, our results align well with the proton radius puzzle observed in the muonic hydrogen measurement data. Furthermore, the study reveals two distinct chemical freeze-out stages in both cases, where the earlier one corresponds to baryonic (hyperonic) and antibaryonic (antihyperonic) states and a later one to mesonic degrees of freedom. A comparison of freeze-out lines obtained from both the cases is made along with the results of some earlier studies."

Neglecting results in an overestimated relative neutron density fluctuation extraction. In contrast, including enhances the agreement with experimental results with higher yield ratios but does not change the energy dependence of the yield ratio. Since the AMPT model does exhibit a first-order phase transition or critical physics, the study fails to reproduce the experimental energy-dependent peak around 20 − 30 GeV. The study'us findings might offer a baseline for investigating critical physics phenomena using light nuclei production as a probe."

      "summary": "In this work, we develop a general perturbative procedure to determine the off-equatorial plane deflections in the weak deflection limit in general stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes, enabling the existence of the generalized Carter constant. Deflections of both null and timelike rays, with the finite distance effect of the source and detector considered, are obtained as dual series of and . These deflections enable a set of exact gravitational lensing equations from which the apparent angular positions of the images are solved. The method and general results are then applied to the Kerr-Newmann, Kerr-Sen, and rotating Simpson-Visser spacetimes to study the effect of the spin and characteristic (effective) charge of the spacetimes and the source altitude on the deflection angles and image apparent angles. We find that, generally, both the spacetime spin and charge affect only the deflections from the second non-trivial order, whereas the source altitude influences the deflection from the leading order. Because of this, measuring the effects of the spacetime spin and charge from the apparent locations of the images in gravitational lensing in realistic scenarios is difficult. We also present the off-equatorial deflections in the rotating Bardeen, Hayward, Ghosh, and Tinchev black hole spacetimes."

Our results show that reduces the peak height and increases the peak width of the spectral function, suggesting that enhances the dissociation of heavy quarkonium. We also discuss the variation in the dissociation of heavy quarkonium with the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density and observe that the dissociation is easier in more perfect plasma. Additionally, we observe that the temperature decreases the peak height and widens the peak, thereby accelerating the dissociation."

The thermal properties of dense matter and the bulk properties of PNSs are investigated under the assumptions of isothermy, isentropy, and fixed lepton fractions. The polytropic index is calculated at finite temperature, revealing a negative correlation with the maximum mass of a PNS that the EOS can support. The properties of PNSs during the heating and cooling stages along their evolutionary path are explored under different combinations of lepton fraction and entropy. We investigate the correlation between symmetry energy slope L and the properties of PNSs. As L increases, the radius of a PNS also increases; however, this effect diminishes with a growing lepton fraction in the isentropic case. These results indicate that nuclear symmetry energy and its density dependence play crucial roles in determining the properties of PNSs and their evolutionary stages."

      "summary": "Studying percolation phase transitions offers valuable insights into the characteristics of phase transitions, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms that govern the formation of global connectivity within a system. We explore the percolation phase transition in the 3D cubic Ising model by employing two machine learning techniques. Our results demonstrate that machine learning methods can distinguish different phases during the percolation transition. Through the finite-size scaling analysis on the output of the neural networks, the percolation temperature and a correlation length exponent in the geometrical percolation transition are extracted and compared to those in the thermal magnetization phase transition within the 3D Ising model. These findings provide a valuable method for enhancing our understanding of the properties of the QCD critical point, which belongs to the same universality class as the 3D Ising model."

      "summary": "The Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) is a large-scale particle accelerator designed to collide electrons and positrons at high energies. One of its primary goals is to achieve high-precision measurements of the properties of the Higgs boson and is facilitated by the large number of Higgs bosons that are produced with significantly low contamination. The measurements of Higgs boson branching fractions into and , where the W or Z bosons decay hadronically, are presented in the context of the CEPC experiment, assuming a scenario with 5600 fb−1 of collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 240 GeV. In this study the Higgs bosons are produced in association with a Z boson, with the Z boson decaying into a pair of muons , which have high efficiency and resolution. To separate all decay channels simultaneously with high accuracy, the Particle Flow Network (PFN), a graph-based machine learning model, is considered. The precise classification provided by the PFN is employed in measuring the branching fractions using the migration matrix method, which accurately corrects for detector effects in each decay channel. The statistical uncertainty of the measured branching ratio is estimated to be 0.55% in the final state and approximately 1.5% − 16% in the final states. In addition, the main sources of systematic uncertainties in the measurement of the branching fractions are discussed."

      "summary": "In this study, the accuracy of the Finite-Range Droplet Model 2012 (FRDM) in describing the α decay energies of the 947 known heavy and superheavy nuclei is investigated. We find evident discrepancies between the α decay energies obtained using the FRDM and those reported by the evaluated atomic mass table AME 2020 (AME). In particular, the FRDM underestimates the experimental α decay energies of superheavy nuclei. The α decay energies of known nuclei obtained using the FRDM are optimized using a neural network approach, i.e., FRDM-NN, and the accuracy improves significantly. The α decay energy systematics obtained using both the FRDM and FRDM-NN exhibit an evident shell effect at neutron number , implying that may be the magic number of the superheavy nucleus region. The α decay half-lives of known superheavy nuclei are calculated using the Generalized Liquid Drop Model (GLDM) and Royer formula with the input of the optimized α decay energies obtained using the FRDM-NN, and the calculations can reproduce the experimental data well. The α decay half-lives of unknown superheavy nuclei, in particular, superheavy nuclei with and 120, are also predicted using the GLDM and Royer formula with the input of the α decay energy obtained using the FRDM-NN. The relative error of two types of predicted α decay half-lives and superposition are analyzed, and the average predictions are given. The α decay energies predicted by the FRDM-NN and the α decay half-lives calculated using the GLDM and Royer formula can provide references for the experimental synthesis of new superheavy elements with and 120."

      "summary": "From an astrophysical perspective, the composition of black holes (BHs), dark matter (DM), and dark energy can be an intriguing physical system. In this study, we consider Schwarzschild BHs embedded in a Dehnen-type DM halo with a quintessential field. This study examines the horizons, shadows, deflection angle, and quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the effective BH spacetime and how they are affected by the dark sector. The Schwarzschild BH embodied in a Dehnen-type DM halo with a quintessential field possesses two horizons: the event and cosmological horizons. We demonstrate that all dark sector parameters increase the event horizon while decreasing the cosmological horizon. We analyze the BH shadow and emphasize the impact of DM and quintessence parameters on the shadow. We show that the dark sector casts larger shadows than a Schwarzschild BH in a vacuum. Further, we delve into the weak gravitational lensing deflection angle using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (GBT). We then investigate the system's QNMs using the 6th order WKB approach. To visually demonstrate the dark sector parameters, we present figures that illustrate the impact of varying the parameters of the Dehnen-type DM halo as well as the quintessence background. Our findings show that the gravitational waves emitted by BHs with a dark sector have a lower frequency and decay rate compared to those emitted by BHs in a vacuum."

Our analysis reveals that the effective charge of the Sen black hole significantly influences these phenomena. Specifically, an increase in the effective charge leads to a decrease in the radius of the photon sphere and a corresponding decrease in the size of the black hole shadow. Additionally, the bending angle of light rays diminishes as the effective charge increases. Our study provides observational bounds on the effective charge based on these optical characteristics. We also examine the magnification of source brightness using the lens equation and analyze the time delay of light in the presence of a surrounding plasma medium. Our findings offer new insights into the impact of effective charge and plasma on the observational signatures of Sen black holes."
