Our numerical experiments suggest some efficient training methods and we explore how the computational cost scales with desired precision, particle number, and system parameters. Roughly speaking, KANs seem to be 10 times cheaper computationally than other neural network based ansatz.

Three forms of LDPs were fitted: the liquid-drop model (LDM), the droplet model (DM), and the power-law dependence on mass number A. Additionally, the root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of the new LDPs and existing literature values were calculated. The newly fitted global LDM-type parameters outperform the commonly used Toke-Swiatecki parameters in various statistical model calculations. In contrast, neither the global nor the combined DM-type parameters yielded satisfactory results. Among the tested parameter sets, the widely adopted Reisdorf parameters exhibited the best overall performance, as evidenced by the larger number of experimental data points falling within their narrower RMSD confidence intervals. For the power-law A-dependence, the new global parameters performed better than the existing homogeneous ones. The ground-state deformation and isospin correction factors had minimal overall impact on the LDP fits. However, the current results suggest that theoretical calculations for transitional nuclei should account for ground-state deformation effects."

The calculated matter radii show excellent agreement with values extracted from low-energy proton and electron elastic scattering data, but are inconsistent with those derived from interaction cross sections and charge-changing cross section measurements. These discrepancies highlight model-dependent ambiguities in the experimental extraction methods of matter radii and underscore the value of precise theoretical benchmarks from NLEFT calculations."

In exploring this region, identification of nuclei with relatively longer half-life as compared to its neighbours is crucial for experimental studies. Such information is provided from theoretical predictions, which are however, heavily dependent on the theoretical model used and observable quantities under investigation.\n  Purpose: Limiting ourselves to the Skyrme Hartree-Fock-plus-Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer approach, we aimed to analyse the appearance of a nuclear region with relatively high stability associated with emergence of spherical and deformed magic numbers in the region of $170 \\le N \\le 190$ ($112 \\le Z \\le 130$) based on various observables.\n  Methods: Three Skyrme parametrizations namely the SkM* frequently employed for fission calculations, and the SLy5 and SLy4 commonly used for superheavy region, are considered to provide comparisons within the Skyrme mean-field approach. We evaluated the variation of electric quadrupole deformation ($\\beta_{20}$), binding energy per nucleon ($BE/A$), two-nucleon separation energy differential ($\\delta S2_{q}$), alpha-decay energy ($Q_{\\alpha}$) and alpha-decay half-lives ($T_{1/2}$).\n  Conclusion: Our analyses suggest that neutron number $N = 178$ is candidate for deformed magic number around proton number $114 \\le Z \\le 118$. For protons, $Z = 120$ and $124$ appears to be a candidate for deformed magic number at around $N = 172 \\sim 178$. Both sets of deformed magic numbers appear at oblate ground-state deformation."

Among the challenges in carrying out this development is handling both the particle-hole and pairing channels beyond the mean-field level, which includes how to incorporate collective degrees of freedom. Here we use the exactly solvable one-dimensional Gaudin-Yang model as a theoretical laboratory to explore candidate approaches. We compare Variational Perturbation Theory (VPT) to ordinary many-body perturbation theory and the inversion method, all to second order in their respective expansions, and verify issues with Hubbard-Stratonovich auxiliary fields. VPT outperforms the other approaches at this level over a wide range of densities. The next steps to extend this approach toward nuclei are outlined."

Using two complementary methodologies, we seek to capture a comprehensive picture of the potential behaviors of ultra-dense nucleonic matter and identify the most plausible models based on current observational and experimental constraints. Observational data from radio pulsar timing, gravitational wave detection of GW170817, and X-ray timing provide critical benchmarks for testing the models. We have derived the EOS posteriors for various CEDF models within the $\\texttt{CompactObject}$ package, utilizing recent observational data on neutron stars, state-of-the-art theoretical constraints from chiral effective field theory ($\\chi$EFT) calculations for pure neutron matter at low densities, and pQCD-derived constraints at approximately $7 \\times 0.16$ $ \\mathrm{fm}^{-3}$. Our analysis has demonstrated that while all considered CEDF models broadly reproduce current astrophysical and theoretical constraints, subtle yet important differences persist among them, with each framework exhibiting distinct characteristics at supra-nuclear density. This is in particular true for the proton fraction inside neutron stars, but also supported by the models' behavior with respect to the pure neutron matter EOS and the density dependence of the speed of sound. Our study highlights the sensitivity of dense matter predictions to the underlying EOS parameterizations and the priors considered."

A comparison of these predictions with the recent (preliminary) CMS data is also performed.

      "summary": "arXiv:2506.02313v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Quantum simulators offer great potential for investigating dynamical properties of quantum field theories. However, preparing accurate non-trivial initial states for these simulations is challenging. Classical Euclidean-time Monte-Carlo methods provide a wealth of information about states of interest to quantum simulations. Thus, it is desirable to facilitate state preparation on quantum simulators using this information. To this end, we present a fully classical pipeline for generating efficient quantum circuits for preparing the ground state of an interacting scalar field theory in 1+1 dimensions. The first element of this pipeline is a variational ansatz family based on the stellar hierarchy for bosonic quantum systems. The second element of this pipeline is the classical moment-optimization procedure that augments the standard variational energy minimization by penalizing deviations in selected sets of ground-state correlation functions (i.e., moments). The values of ground-state moments are sourced from classical Euclidean methods. The resulting states yield comparable ground-state energy estimates but exhibit distinct correlations and local non-Gaussianity. The third element of this pipeline is translating the moment-optimized ansatz into an efficient quantum circuit with an asymptotic cost that is polynomial in system size. This work opens the way to systematically applying classically obtained knowledge of states to prepare accurate initial states in quantum field theories of interest in nature."

Compared to the non-relativistic case, there are significant differences in the distribution of bound state poles and resonance poles in the relativistic case, primarily due to the square root term in the relativistic formula. By considering pure two-particle scattering, we examine the relationship between the form factor and the number of poles. Additionally, we clearly elucidate the effects of attractive and repulsive interactions on the bound state poles and resonance poles. More importantly, we extend our model by including a bare state and explore the poles originating from the bare state or coupled channels through the trajectories of pole positions, as well as the compositeness of bound states."

The effective degrees of freedom are scalars, pseudo-scalars, diquarks, and quarks. The parameters in the scalar/pseudo-scalar sector can be determined by matching the meson pole masses and decay constants to their observed values using the on-shell renormalization scheme. The remaining parameters are in the diquark sector and a priori unknown. In principle, they can be calculated from QCD, but we consider them free. We renormalize the thermodynamic potential in the 2SC phase for two flavors and in the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase for three flavors, determining the counterterms of the couplings in the diquark sector. We derive a set of renormalization group equations for these couplings that are used to improve the thermodynamic potential. As an application, we calculate the gap and the speed of sound in the ideal CFL phase. It is shown that the gap approaches a constant as $\\mu_B\\rightarrow\\infty$ and that the speed of sound relaxes to the conformal limit from above."

We consider self-interacting, nonannihilating, asymmetric fermionic DM that couples to NSs only through gravitational interaction. Using the Quantum Monte Carlo Relativistic Mean Field (QMC-RMF4) model with density-dependent magnetic fields, we investigate the magnetized equation of state and examine the accumulation of DM under various conditions. Our results show that as the DM fraction increases, the maximum gravitational mass of the NS decreases, especially for heavier DM particles, while lighter DM particles can induce a transition from a dark core to a halo structure, increasing the maximum mass. Strong MFs soften the equation of state and reduce the dark mass a NS core can retain before transitioning to a halo. By comparing our results with observations from Neutro Star Interior Composition Explorer and GW170817, we identify the possible range of DM parameters for these objects. We find that the magnetic field slightly changes these limits, mainly affecting the maximum NS mass and tidal deformability. These findings provide key insights into how DM and MF jointly shape the mass-radius relation and the stability of DM-admixed magnetized NSs."

Our findings show that the EMFFs of charged (neutral) mesons exhibit a faster fall-off (increase) with increasing four-momentum transfer squared and nuclear density. Consequently, the absolute value of the charge radii of mesons increases with nuclear density, where the rate of increase depends on their quark flavor contents. We observe that the EMFFs of pions and kaons undergo significant modifications in the nuclear medium, while heavy-light mesons are only slightly modified. By decomposing the quark flavor contributions to EMFFs, we show that the medium effects primarily impact the light-quark sector, leaving the heavy-quark sector nearly unaffected. The results of this study further suggest the importance of the medium effects at the quark level."

      "summary": "arXiv:2412.20880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We study the femtoscopic correlation functions of meson-baryon pairs in the strangeness $S=-1$ sector, employing unitarized s-wave scattering amplitudes derived from the chiral Lagrangian up to next-to-leading order. For the first time, we deliver predictions on the $\\pi^-\\Lambda$ and $K^+\\Xi^-$ correlation functions which are feasible to be measured at the Large Hadron Collider. We also demonstrate that the employed model is perfectly capable of reproducing the $K^-p$ correlation function data measured by the same collaboration, without the need to modify the coupling strength to the $\\bar{K}^0n$ channel, as has been recently suggested. In all cases, the effects of the source size on the correlation are tested. In addition, we present detailed analysis of the different coupled-channel contributions, together with the quantification of the relative relevance of the different terms in the interaction. These calculations require the knowledge of the so-called production weights, for which we present two novel methods to compute them."

      "summary": "arXiv:2502.19329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We have addressed here the problem of calculating the correlation function of a stable particle with a resonance, in particular one resonance that qualifies as a molecular state of two components. The formalism used requires to evaluate the scattering matrix of the stable particle with the molecule, a nuclear problem which we address by means of the fixed center approximation. We have applied the method to the interaction of a proton with the $f_1(1285)$ resonance, presently under investigation by the ALICE collaboration, where the $f_1(1285)$ is taken as a $K^*\\bar{K}-\\bar{K}^*K$ molecule. We find that the $p ~ f_1(1285)$ interaction develops a resonance state below the $p ~ f_1(1285)$ threshold, which leads to a depletion in the $p ~ f_1(1285)$ correlation function for small values of the proton momentum. The discussion presented shows that these type of studies can provide much information on the nature of some resonances and the existence of three-body bound states involving mesons and baryons."

      "summary": "Phase transitions in hot 160−164Dy isotopes are analyzed using a classification scheme based on the distribution of zeros of the canonical ensemble (CE) partition function in the complex inverse temperature plane. Semi-empirical nuclear level densities (NLD), which are obtained by combining experimental data in the excitation-energy region below the neutron binding energy and the back-shifted Fermi gas model prediction for the high excitation-energy up to 250 MeV, are utilized to determine the CE partition function. Results obtained show that two phase transitions can appear in 160−164Dy isotopes, namely the pairing phase transition and the shape phase transition. The pairing phase transition is found to be of first-order and its critical temperature is ∼0.5 MeV, while the shape phase transition is found to be also of first-order but it occurs at higher temperatures, i.e. around 2.2–2.5 MeV. A comparison between this work and previous ones that involve the same classification scheme but employ purely theoretical NLD has shown a considerable inconsistency. However, our findings should be more conclusive due to various supports from previous theoretical and experimental studies."

      "summary": "A method for the direct integration of the three-dimensional Faddeev equations with respect to the breakup T-matrix in momentum space for three-body systems with differing masses is presented. The Faddeev equations are explicitly formulated without imposing symmetry or antisymmetry requirements on the two-body t-matrices, thus accounting for mass differences between the three interacting particles. An algorithm for the algebraic determination of non-relativistic wave functions for three-body systems with arbitrary masses is given. Furthermore, it is directly demonstrated how the domain of logarithmic singularities in the integral kernels of the Faddeev equations is significantly altered by varying the masses of the interacting particles. The developed method for traversing logarithmic singularities is tested using the example of calculating the total cross sections for elastic neutron-deuteron scattering and breakup reaction."
