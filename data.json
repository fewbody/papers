In this work, for the first time, we apply conformal-prediction to generate uncertainty bands for physical observables in nuclear physics, such as the total cross section and nucleon-nucleon phase shifts. We demonstrate the method's flexibility by considering three scenarios: (i) a pointwise model, where expansion coefficients in chiral effective field theory are treated as random variables; (ii) a Gaussian-Process model for the coefficients; and (iii) phase shifts at various energies and partial waves calculated using local interactions from chiral effective field theory. In each case, conformal-prediction intervals are constructed and validated empirically. Our results show that conformal prediction provides reliable and adaptive uncertainty bands even in the presence of non-Gaussian behavior, such as skewness and heavy tails. These findings highlight conformal prediction as a robust and practical framework for quantifying theoretical uncertainties."

      "summary": "arXiv:2507.08199v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Bound-state $\\beta^-$-decay is a rare radioactive process where the created electron is trapped in an atomic orbital instead of being emitted. It can be observed in highly ionized atoms in particular when normal beta decay is energetically forbidden, but bound-state decay is still possible. In this work we present a systematic theoretical study on the bound-state $\\beta^-$-decay of fully ionized atoms where key nuclear inputs include the nuclear matrix elements (expressed through $ft$ values) and the lepton phase-space volume function. We present a method to evaluate nuclear matrix elements for fully forbidden $\\beta^-$ transitions in neutral atoms, from the inverse electron capture process using the Takahashi-Yokoi model and account for the impact of electron capture to different atomic orbitals on the resulting half-lives. Decay rates for bound-state $\\beta^-$-decays of nuclei $^{163}$Dy, $^{193}$Ir, $^{194}$Au, $^{202}$Tl, $^{205}$Tl, $^{215}$At, $^{222}$Rn, $^{243}$Am, and $^{246}$Bk are calculated, where the normal beta decay is forbidden. In addition, we compute the bound-state $\\beta^-$ decay rates for nuclei $^{187}$Re, $^{227}$Ac, and $^{228}$Ra, observing enhancements by factors of $10^2$ to $10^4$ relative to their neutral-atom counterparts. Our results show that the half-lives of certain bare nuclei are significantly shorter than those of the corresponding neutral atoms, identifying them as promising candidates for future experimental investigation. The theoretically predicted half-lives of the bound-state $\\beta^-$ decay could provide valuable inputs for various astrophysical studies."

Building on the high-fidelity chiral Hamiltonian introduced in Ref. [1], we compute scattering phase shifts in the $S$- and $P$-wave channels using the L\\\"uscher finite-volume method. Our results demonstrate excellent agreement with empirical $R$-matrix phase shifts in the $^2S_{1/2}$ and $^2P_{3/2}$ channels, while revealing persistent discrepancies in the $^2P_{1/2}$ channel for neutron energies above 5 MeV. To systematically investigate these discrepancies, we construct and analyze a simplified neutron-alpha toy model, demonstrating that these discrepancies are not due to the use of the L\\\"uscher finite-volume method. Additionally, we revisit our three-nucleon (3N) force fitting procedure, explicitly incorporating neutron-alpha scattering data through comprehensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. This analysis confirms the stability of nuclear binding-energy predictions and highlights the need for further refinements in the lattice N3LO three-nucleon forces to fully describe neutron-alpha scattering in the challenging ${}^2P_{1/2}$ channel."

The result shows a mode near 100 MeV, and a combined analysis with neutron-proton scattering further sharpens the inference, placing the mode close to the pion mass scale, consistent with the expected range of pionless effective field theory."

      "summary": "arXiv:2507.08130v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We investigate the influence of spin polarization in strongly interacting matter by introducing a finite spin potential, $\\mu_\\Sigma$, which effectively controls the spin density of the system without requiring rotation or specific boundary conditions. Inspired by recent lattice QCD simulations that incorporated such a potential, we implement this approach within an effective QCD framework. Our results show that increasing spin polarization leads to a simultaneous decrease in both the chiral and deconfinement restoration temperatures. The resulting phase structure is qualitatively consistent with lattice findings, and notably, we observe the emergence of a first-order chiral phase transition at low temperature. These results suggest that spin-polarized environments can significantly impact the QCD phase diagram and offer a controlled route for studying spin effects in hot and dense matter."

We adopt a renormalization scheme that induces a reasonable short-distance behavior of the two-hadron wave functions, which is the major limitation of femtoscopy techniques at this time. We perform an exhaustive spectroscopy study, implementing different improvements and considerations, and find compatibilities between the poles extracted from the present approach, and some of the states listed in the Review of Particle Physics. Finally, we predict several correlation functions (CFs) associated with various meson-baryon pairs in this sector, paying special attention to the distinctive and clear signatures produced by the dynamically generated states. To obtain realistic estimates for the CFs, we have calculated the production weights using the Thermal-FIST package. Such studies will shed light into the odd-parity $\\Lambda^*$ and $\\Sigma^*$ hadron spectra, up to 2 GeV, and will open the strategy to improve effective field theories by using low-energy constants fitted to femtoscopy data."

The scattering can happen through two distinct mechanisms: the coupled-channel mechanism via open-charm meson-baryon intermediate states, and the soft-gluon exchange mechanism. We investigate the $J/\\psi N$ $S$-wave scattering length through both mechanisms, and find that the soft-gluon exchange mechanism leads to a scattering length at least one order of magnitude larger than that from the coupled-channel mechanism and thus is the predominant one. The findings can be verified by lattice calculations and will enhance our understanding of the scattering processes breaking the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule."

      "summary": "arXiv:2411.09912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The Moskowitz-Lombardi rule gives a simple relation between the magnetic moment of an atomic nucleus and the effect of its radial distribution on the hyperfine structure - the magnetic hyperfine anomaly or \"Bohr-Weisskopf\" effect. It was originally formulated for mercury, for which experimental data for nuclear magnetic moments and hyperfine constants were available for a number of isotopes. While the relation for the differential effect between isotopes may be completely determined experimentally, the value for the additive constant that is needed to give the Bohr-Weisskopf (BW) effect for a single isotope has remained untested. In this work, we determine the BW effect in singly-ionized and neutral mercury from experimental muonic Hg-199 data together with our atomic calculations. We check this result by directly extracting the BW effect from the hyperfine constant for singly-ionized Hg-199 using state-of-the-art atomic many-body calculations. From this we deduce an empirical value for the additive constant in the Moskowitz-Lombardi rule, which differs significantly from the values advocated previously."

Considering this, we first examine the pre-equilibrium state of QCD matter and its effect on the initially produced charmonium using a temperature-independent Hamiltonian. As the QCD matter reaches local thermal equilibrium, this Hamiltonian transforms to its finite temperature counterpart. To model the pre-equilibrium stage, we use the bottom-up thermalization approach to determine the effective temperature of the QCD matter, followed by a Gubser-type expansion for the thermalized medium. Additionally, we consider collisional damping, gluonic dissociation, and regeneration mechanisms, which specifically modify the charmonium yield in the thermalized medium. Mainly, the gluonic dissociation and collisional damping cause a reduction in the yield conversely, regeneration through gluonic deexcitation enhances the yield of charmonium. Further, we explore the combined effects of these mechanisms on the collective yield of charmonium states with transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) and event multiplicity in the proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. Based on our findings, we contend that the combined effects of these mechanisms can serve as a robust probe for determining the possible existence of a thermalized QCD medium in such a small collision system."
