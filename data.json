After a brief discussion about hydrostatic equilibrium, I discuss the role of each meson of the model and how to calculate the corresponding equation of state and the expected values. Each meson is introduced individually. Its effects are analyzed from both an analytical and a numerical point of view. To explicitly show the effects of a given meson, the coupling constant is varied in an arbitrary range before being fixed to reproduce well-known constraints. This work is intended for late undergraduate students as well as early graduate students. The equation of states is obtained from the statistical mechanics formalism, which is more familiar to students at this stage of their research career, instead of the traditional quantum field theory formalism."

In this work, we investigate thermal dilepton spectra and their elliptic flow through the dynamical conductivity that governs the production rate. The conductivity is obtained from the trace of the spectral function within relativistic kinetic theory using the Relaxation Time Approximation. This allows us to derive for the first time an analytical expression for the dilepton rate with explicit dependence on the relaxation time of quark-antiquark interactions. We find a non-monotonic dependence of the dilepton rate on the relaxation time and compare the resulting transverse momentum, invariant mass spectra and elliptic flow with previous quantum field theory results. The spectra and elliptic flow are obtained by integrating the rate over the full spacetime volume of the evolving medium, using temperature and flow profiles from realistic MUSIC hydrodynamic simulations without considering the effect of magnetic fields in the profiles itself. However, we study the role of an external space-time dependent magnetic field by making the conductivity anisotropic. At small relaxation times, magnetic fields have negligible impact, while for larger relaxation times and stronger initial fields, modifications of up to $\\sim$20\\% appear in both spectra and elliptic flow. Assuming instead a constant magnetic field of $\\sim 1\\,m_{\\pi}^2$ at large relaxation times yields more modest effects, with changes of about 10\\% in spectra and 5\\% in elliptic flow."

These solutions naturally decompose into a divergent gradient series and exponentially decaying non-perturbative modes that encode initial conditions. The non-perturbative contributions are essential for understanding causality, the divergence of the gradient series, and the unexpected effectiveness of relativistic hydrodynamics far from equilibrium.\n  In the 0+1D Bjorken scenario, we demonstrate that the exact evolution of non-equilibrium terms shares the same structural form as the gradient expansion, differing only through modified transport coefficients that reflect both initial data and free-streaming dynamics. Extending to 3+1D, we find that hydrodynamics remains effective not because the system is close to equilibrium, but because it interpolates smoothly between free streaming and collective behavior. This perspective offers a natural explanation for the remarkable success of hydrodynamics in modeling quark-gluon plasma evolution."

This enables results from lower orders to inform statistical predictions for error estimates of omitted higher orders. We test the model for multiple chiral EFT ($\\chi$EFT) nucleon-nucleon (NN) potentials using a suite of six common NN scattering observables represented as functions of relative momentum and scattering angle. First, we flag irregularity in the convergence patterns of potentials with so-called \"soft\" regulator scales, namely that the sizes of the coefficients in the observables' expansions are mismatched between the even and odd orders. Second, we test the BUQEYE model's assumption of Gaussian process (GP) stationarity against the data and find that the GP's correlation structure as encoded in its length scale is nonstationary: The GP length scale in the angular dimension $\\ell_{\\theta}$ is approximately inversely proportional to the relative momentum of the scattering process. After we remediate this issue by allowing $\\ell_{\\theta}$ to vary with momentum, diagnostics show significant improvement, validating the application of the BUQEYE model after this modification. Third, we find that good performance of the BUQEYE model relies on properly choosing the $\\chi$EFT breakdown scale $\\Lambda_{b}$. With $m_{\\text{eff}}$ held fixed at the physical pion mass we find $\\Lambda_{b}=600$--$750$ MeV for various N$^{3}$LO interactions. Statistically consistent distributions for $\\Lambda_{b}$ across orders are only found for the SMS potential at a regulator scale of 450 or 500 MeV.

Different from the magnetic field effect, the fermion wave function in an electric field oscillates asymptotically, which reflects the Klein paradox in the relativistic case and results in the absence of bound states in an infinite system. For a confined fermion, the confinement is gradually canceled by the electric field, and the fermion becomes deconfined when the electric coupling is stronger than the confinement coupling. However, a fermion in an electric field can be confined to a finite system by applying the MIT bag boundary condition, namely, the disappearing normal component of the probability current at the boundary. The result of this work can be applied to the physics of relativistic heavy ion collisions, where the strongest electric field in nature is expected to be created."

Two important improvements are introduced: i) charge radii used to constrain the length parameter are evaluated within a generalized formula, where proton occupation numbers are substituted by sums of spectroscopic factors, while radial wave functions are required to match separation energies with respect to the intermediate $(A-1)$-nucleon states by adjusting parameters such as the potential depth; ii) configuration mixing wave functions and energies for many-particle states are obtained through the diagonalization of well-established effective interactions in large configuration spaces without truncation. Furthermore, a variation of $\\pm0.1$\\,fm in the surface diffuseness parameter is now incorporated as a source of uncertainty. The present results are generally in fairly good agreement with those from previous studies. As an exception, the $\\delta_{C2}$ value obtained for $^{18}$Ne is smaller by approximately a factor of two, principally due to the updated charge-radius treatment. A reduction is also observed in most cases with $A\\ge38$, through the deviations generally remain within the newly assigned error bars. The smaller isospin-mixing counterpart, $\\delta_{C1}$, is strongly interaction-dependent, roughly following an inverse-square law with respect to the energy separation between the lowest admixed levels. Therefore, an additional procedure to ensure isobaric displacements within the isospin multiplets appears to be indispensable. Our results for $\\delta_{C2}$ lead to a new averaged $\\overline{\\mathcal{F}t}$ value of $3073.11(99)_{stat}(36)_{\\delta_R'}(173)_{\\delta_{NS}}$~s with $\\chi^2/\\nu=0.624$.

These ejecta properties are potentially affected by dynamically-important feedback from $r$-process heating, which is usually not coupled to the hydrodynamics in post-merger simulations modeling the ejecta launching and expansion. The multi-messenger detection of GW170817 showed the importance of producing reliable ejecta predictions, to maximize the diagnostic potential of future events. In this paper, we develop a prescription for including $r$-process heating as a source term in the hydrodynamic equations. This prescription depends on local fluid properties and on the $Y_{e}$ history as recorded by dedicated tracer particles, which exchange information with the grid using the Cloud-in-Cell method. The method is implemented in long-term viscous hydrodynamic simulations of accretion disk outflows to investigate its feedback on ejecta properties. We find that $r$-process heating can increase the unbound disk ejecta mass by $\\sim 10\\%$ relative to a baseline case that only considers alpha particle recombination. Nuclear heating also enhances the radial velocity of the ejecta with $Y_e < 0.25$ by up to a factor of two, while concurrently suppressing marginally-bound convective ejecta."

Polyakov et al. that the QCD momentum current density (MCD) $T^{ij}$ in the nucleon, characterized by the form factor $C/D$ of the QCD energy-momentum tensor, can be interpreted as the pressure and shear force distributions inside the nucleon because its interior seems to approximate a continuous mechanical medium. By examining the physics content of MCDs in various classical and quantum systems, we find that momentum current flow originates from both kinetic motion of particles and forces between them, and furthermore, the forces alone cannot determine the interaction MCDs unambiguously, same as the interaction energy potentials and consistent with Noether's theorem. Only in special cases where there are short-range forces between different elements of a system, or short-range interactions with external boundaries that result in discontinuities of MCDs, can the relevant components be interpreted as surface forces, i.e., mechanical pressures and shear forces. For the nucleon in QCD, the range of quark and gluon interactions is comparable to its size and far from short, and we fail to identify any interaction component of the MCD as pressure/shear forces between different parts of the nucleon, nor the total through the form factor $C/D$ which merely depicts the total momentum flux seen through gravity. Following our previous study of the forces through divergences of kinetic MCDs, we affirm that the gluon scalar field in the QCD trace anomaly provides a confining force potential on the quarks, with a strength consistent with that between heavy quarks."

Rigid rotation is introduced through a specific metric that explicitly depends on the angular velocity $\\Omega$. We begin by determining the free propagator for this model at finite temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\\mu$. Using this propagator, we calculate the thermodynamic potential in terms of an energy dispersion relation $\\epsilon_{k}$. It is found that in both the U(1) symmetric phase and the symmetry-broken phase, two energy branches emerge. In the symmetry-broken phase, they are identified with a massive phonon and a massless roton mode. Notably, rotation does not alter $\\epsilon_{k}$ at low momentum. Setting $\\mu=0$, we use the total thermodynamic potential, which includes classical, thermal, vacuum, and nonperturbative ring contributions, to explore how the condensate depends on $T$ and $\\Omega$. We first focus on the classical and thermal parts of the thermodynamic potential and find that the critical temperature of the U(1) phase transition scales as $\\Omega^{1/3}$.

This approach is particularly promising for large liquid xenon detectors, such as the proposed PandaX-xT and XLZD experiments, which are capable of identifying decays of $^{136}$Xe to excited states with high efficiency. Our analysis demonstrates that such a combined multi-transition analysis can improve the sensitivity to $|m_{\\beta\\beta}|$ by more than a factor of two for a nominal xenon detector setup, and by up to an order of magnitude in an ideal scenario, potentially accelerating access to the entire inverted ordering regime.

Relativistic spin hydrodynamics provides an effective low-energy framework to describe these processes in quantum many-body systems. The fundamental symmetry underlying relativistic spin hydrodynamics is angular momentum conservation, which naturally leads to inter-conversion between spin and orbital angular momenta. This inter-conversion is a key feature of relativistic spin hydrodynamics, closely related to entropy production and introducing ambiguity in the construction of constitutive relations. In this article, we present a pedagogical introduction to relativistic spin hydrodynamics. We demonstrate how to derive the constitutive relations by applying local thermodynamic laws and explore several distinctive aspects of spin hydrodynamics. These include the pseudo-gauge ambiguity, the behavior of the system in the presence of strong vorticity, and the challenges of modeling the freeze-out of spin in heavy-ion collisions.

We directly compare its output to the same network trained at multiple temperatures below and above $T_{\\rm c}$ to gain understanding of how this extreme restriction of training data can impact a neural network's ability to classify phases.
