In the generalized TDGCM, the correlated nuclear wave function is represented as a coherent superposition of time-dependent DFT trajectories. In the first realistic application, a large basis of 25 TDDFT trajectories is employed to calculate the charge yields and total kinetic energy distribution for the fission of $^{240}$Pu. The results are compared with available data, and with those obtained using a standard TDDFT, that does not consider quantum fluctuations, and the adiabatic TDGCM+GOA (Gaussian overlap approximation). It is shown that fragment yields and kinetic energies can simultaneously be described in a consistent microscopic framework that includes fluctuations in the collective degrees of freedom and the one-body dissipation mechanism."

We show that, at saturation density, the equation-of-state dependence of these transport quantities is fully determined by the experimentally constrained nuclear symmetry energy $S$ and its slope $L$. Variations of $L$ within current experimental uncertainties can change the (frequency-independent) bulk viscosity by orders of magnitude. This suggests that dissipative effects encoded in the gravitational-wave signatures of binary neutron star inspirals may help constrain nuclear symmetry energy properties."

We solve the wavefunction of the physical quark state by diagonalizing the QCD Hamiltonian in vacuum in a $\\ket{q}+\\ket{qg}$ Fock space, with implementing the sector-dependent mass renormalization scheme. We then perform numerical simulations of the real-time quantum state evolution of the initially dressed quark state at various medium densities. The results are compared with those of an initially bare or off-shell quark states. With the obtained light-front wavefunction of the evolved state, we extract the quark jet transverse momentum broadening, the quenching parameter, the cross section, the gluon emission rate, and the evolution of the invariant mass. The scenario considered is relevant for high energy scattering processes, where the quark originates from far outside the color field describing the scattering target. This investigation on dressed quarks complements our earlier studies of the single quark scattering in the $\\ket{q}$ Fock space, and of the bare quark scattering in the $\\ket{q}+\\ket{qg}$ Fock space, providing a novel systematic description of quark scattering process using a non-perturbative formalism."

Our study employs a two-parameter representation of the DA at $\\zeta=2$ GeV, designed to capture the expected broadening and asymmetry of the distribution, as well as the soft endpoint behavior predicted by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Our leading-order analysis of the latest experimental measurements of $\\mathcal{R}_K$ reveals that the extracted DA exhibits a somewhat significant skewness, with the first symmetric moment approximately $\\langle 1-2x \\rangle_K= 0.082(7)$. On the other hand, the brodaness and general shape of the produced distributions show a reasonable consistency with contemporaty lattice and continuum QCD analyses. These findings highlight the importance of accurately determining the profile of the DA, especially the skewness and its relation to $SU_F(3)$ flavor symmetry breaking, as well as the inclusion of higher-order effects in the hard-scattering kernels for analyzing data at experimentally accessible scales."

      "summary": "arXiv:2504.07659v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We investigate tidal heating associated with the binary inspiral of strange quark stars and its impact on the resulting gravitational wave signal. Tidal heating during the merger of neutron stars composed of nuclear matter may be considered negligible, but it has been demonstrated recently that the presence of hyperons at high densities could significantly enhance the dissipation during inspiral. In this work, we evaluate the bulk viscosity arising from non-leptonic weak processes involving quarks and show that it can be several orders of magnitude higher than the viscosity of nuclear matter at temperatures relevant to the inspiral phase of the merger of strange stars. We model strange quark matter in the normal phase using a non-ideal bag model including electrons and ensure compatibility with astrophysical constraints. By analysing equal-mass binary systems with component masses ranging from 1.4 to 1.8 $\\, M_{\\odot}$, we find that temperatures close to 0.1 MeV are reached by the end of the inspiral phase. We also estimate the effect on the gravitational waveform and conclude that the additional phase shift could range from $0.1$ to $0.5$ radians for strange quark masses of 200 MeV, making it potentially detectable by next-generation gravitational wave detectors. Given that tidal heating from hyperons is dominant only for very massive neutron stars having masses 1.8 to 2.0 $\\, M_{\\odot}$, a successful detection of this phase shift during the inspiral of binary systems with relatively low masses of 1.4 to 1.6 $\\, M_{\\odot}$ could be a smoking gun signature for the existence of strange quark stars."

With recent advancements in gravitational-wave and electromagnetic astronomy, we are nearing the capability to perform neutron-star asteroseismology and probe the complex physics of neutron stars. With this in mind, we explore the implementation of three-parameter finite-temperature matter models in the computation of neutron-star oscillations. We consider in detail the thermodynamics of nuclear matter and show how this information enters the problem. Our realistic treatment takes into account entropy and composition gradients that exist in the nuclear matter, giving rise to buoyant g-mode oscillations. To illustrate the implementation, we determine the oscillation spectrum of a low-temperature neutron star. In addition to the expected compositional and thermal g-modes, we find perturbations sourced by phase transitions in the equation of state. We also examine two thermal models, comparing the results for constant redshifted temperature with those for uniform entropy per baryon."

The light meson emissions for the low-lying $\\rho-$mode states are highly suppressed due to the orthogonality of wave functions between initial and final states. Moreover, the strong decay behaviors for doubly charmed and bottom baryons preserve the heavy superflavor symmetry well, where the small violation originates from the finite heavy quark masses and different phase spaces.

The existence of the $DDD^*$ bound state remains uncertain due to significant variations in the OBE interaction, particularly in the strength of scalar-meson-exchange interactions, which can differ by a factor about 20 between two commonly used OBE models. This discrepancy renders the $DDD^*$ system highly model-dependent. To address this issue, we constrain the scalar-meson-exchange interaction using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position, where the pseudoscalar-meson coupling is well-determined, and the $\\rho$- and $\\omega$-exchange interactions nearly cancel each other out, leaving the coupling constant of the $\\sigma$-exchange as the only unknown parameter. Our results indicate that the isospin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ $DDD^*$ bound states exist when $Z_c(3900)$ is a virtual state of $D\\bar{D}^*/\\bar{D}D^*$ located within approximately $-15$ MeV of the threshold. However, the three-body bound state is gone when the $Z_c(3900)$ virtual state pole is more than $20$ MeV away from the threshold. Each experimental progress, either on the $DDD^*$ state or the $Z_c(3900)$, can shed light on the nature of the other state. Another significant outcome is a refined set of OBE model parameters calibrated using the pole positions of $X(3872)$, $T_{cc}(3875)$, and $Z_c(3900)$, rigorously addressing the cutoff dependence. These parameters provide a valuable resource for more accurate calculations of systems involving few-body $D$, $D^*$ and their antiparticles. Additionally, we find no evidence of the $DDD^*$ three-body resonances after extensive search using a combination of the Gaussian expansion method and the complex scaling method."

      "summary": "arXiv:2412.18569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The composition and equation of state (EoS) of dense matter relevant to compact stars are quite inconclusive. However, certain observational constraints on the structural properties of compact stars help us constrain the EoS to a fair extent. Moreover, gravitational asteroseismology gives a notion of the composition and EoS of compact stars. The next generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors are likely to detect several oscillation mode frequencies of the GWs. In this work we compute the fundamental ($f$) and the first pressure ($p_1$) mode frequencies ($f_f$ and $f_{p1}$, respectively) with different compositions viz., hadronic, quark, and hybrid star (HS) matter. For HSs, we also study the gravity ($g$) mode frequency ($f_g$). For each phase we also study the correlation between the oscillation frequencies of 1.4 $M_{\\odot}$ and 2.01 $M_{\\odot}$ compact stars with other different properties. We find that various possible composition of compact stars substantially affects the oscillation frequencies. However, the mass-scaled angular $f$ mode frequency ($\\omega_f M$) varies universally with compactness ($C$) for all hadronic, quark and hybrid stars. The $f$ mode frequency ($f_{f_{1.4}}$) of the canonical 1.4 $M_{\\odot}$ compact star, obtained with different composition, is quite correlated with the canonical radius ($R_{1.4}$) and tidal deformability ($\\Lambda_{1.4}$) while $f_{p_{1.4}}$ is well correlated with slope parameter of the symmetry energy. We also show that $f_{g_{1.4}}$ of the HSs varies almost linearly with $\\Lambda_{1.4}$. Should $g$ modes be detected, they could not only support the existence of HSs, but $f_g$ could be useful to understand the strength of quark repulsion in HSs."
